Milestone 7 - Advanced Topics Building from the previous milestone, expand upon the starter project by adding the following features:
Metadata List View - add a view to show all metadata available in the application. You MAY NOT use the PrimeVue DataTable component for this. Instead, develop your own method to display these items (for example, consider using the PrimeVue DataView along with your own custom component for showing each individual metadata item). Metadata Single View - each metadata item in the Metadata List View should be clickable and direct users to a page showing all data about that metadata item, including all linked communities and documents. Edit Metadata View - for users with the appropriate roles, display buttons to edit and delete metadata items. Users should be able to edit all items of a metadata item except owner_user_id (this should be set on the backend to the currently authenticated user) and copyright_id (this can be set to a default value of “1”). Manage Documents &amp; Communities - for users with the appropriate roles, include methods for adding and removing documents and communities from a metadata item. For 10% extra credit each, implement the following features:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-milestones/07-advanced-topics/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
