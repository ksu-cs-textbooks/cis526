Most menu items and routes are protected and only allow users with specific roles to view/access them A page that lists all roles in the application for anyone with the manage_users role. Roles are not editable. A page that lists all users in a data table for anyone with the manage_users role. Helpful columns on that page should be searchable and sortable, as well as the ability to filter by role. A page to edit existing users, including updating their roles. A page to create new users and assign new roles. A method to delete existing users.

A page to create new communities and associated with a county, for anyone with the manage_communities and add_communities roles. A method to delete existing communities, for anyone with the manage_communities role. For this milestone, you may hard-code the frontend to have all new communities owned by user ID 1 admin A page that lists all documents in a data table for anyone with the view_documents, manage_documents and add_documents roles. Helpful columns on that page should be searchable and sortable. Document filenames should be clickable, and it should direct users to the appropriate file on the server (if such file exists; this should work for all uploaded files) A page to edit existing documents, for anyone with the manage_documents role. A page to create new documents, for anyone with the manage_documents and add_documents roles. A method to delete existing documents, for anyone with the manage_documents role.

You can continue to use the Express static file middleware to serve these files.</p><h4 id=file-uploads>File Uploads</h4><p>To simplify the file upload process, you may want to ensure that files are named with the appropriate file extensions to match their mimetypes on the server. Below is an example if you are using <a href=https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/multer.html rel=external target=_blank>multer</a> to handle file uploads - it uses <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid rel=external target=_blank>nanoid</a> to generate random filenames and <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-types rel=external target=_blank>mime-types</a> to get the correct file extension to match the mimetype of the file. You can then store the filename, size, and mimetype you get from multer in your endpoint for uploading files.</p><div class=tab-panel data-tab-group=725fbcf1362a7a58fa90c12eb2721c73><div class=tab-nav><div class=tab-nav-title>&#8203;</div><button data-tab-item=document-api-handler class="tab-nav-button tab-panel-style cstyle initial active" tabindex=-1 onclick='switchTab("725fbcf1362a7a58fa90c12eb2721c73","document-api-handler")'>
