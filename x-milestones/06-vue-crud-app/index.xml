Milestone 6 - Vue.js CRUD App Building from the previous milestone, expand upon the starter project by adding the following features:
Most menu items and routes are protected and only allow users with specific roles to view/access them A page that lists all roles in the application for anyone with the manage_users role. Roles are not editable. A page that lists all users in a data table for anyone with the manage_users role. Helpful columns on that page should be searchable and sortable, as well as the ability to filter by role. A page to edit existing users, including updating their roles. A page to create new users and assign new roles. A method to delete existing users. A page that lists all counties in the application for anyone with the view_communities, manage_communities and add_communities roles. Counties are not editable. A page that lists all communities in a data table for anyone with the view_communities, manage_communities and add_communities roles. Helpful columns on that page should be searchable and sortable. A page to edit existing communities, including changing the county that they are in, for anyone with the manage_communities role. A page to create new communities and associated with a county, for anyone with the manage_communities and add_communities roles. A method to delete existing communities, for anyone with the manage_communities role. For this milestone, you may hard-code the frontend to have all new communities owned by user ID 1 admin A page that lists all documents in a data table for anyone with the view_documents, manage_documents and add_documents roles. Helpful columns on that page should be searchable and sortable. Document filenames should be clickable, and it should direct users to the appropriate file on the server (if such file exists; this should work for all uploaded files) A page to edit existing documents, for anyone with the manage_documents role. A page to create new documents, for anyone with the manage_documents and add_documents roles. A method to delete existing documents, for anyone with the manage_documents role. When creating or editing a document, users should also have the ability to upload a new file for that document. We will NOT be handling the interface for metadata in this milestone. That will be the last milestone for this project.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-milestones/06-vue-crud-app/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
