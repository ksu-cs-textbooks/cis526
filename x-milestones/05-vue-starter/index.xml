Milestone 5 - Vue Starter Project Follow the instructions in the Example Project to build a project using Vue.js that includes the following features:
A single page frontend application running in Vue 3. Built-in Vue features such as Vue Router and Pinia. Access to components and icons from PrimeVue. Access to Tailwind CSS for additional CSS styling and features. A working Dark Mode Theme completed with a selector that remembers our preference. A working Vite server that will proxy requests to our backend RESTful API seamlessly. An Axios client that can access our RESTful API routes. A seamless system for authentication and requesting a JWT to access protected API routes. A demo of accessing the API on the /profile page listing all users and roles assigned to those users (this page should load correctly for the admin user) Effectively, just follow along with the example project and submit the resulting repository. This will be the starting point for the rest of the milestones!</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-milestones/05-vue-starter/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
