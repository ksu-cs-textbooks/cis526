Instead, they sought to build the entire web server as a custom program.
Node was actually developed for exactly this approach - it provides abstractions around the fundamental aspects of HTTP in its http library. This library handles the listening for HTTP requests, and parses the request and uses it to populate a http.ClientRequest object and provides a http.ServerResponse object to prepare and send the response. These are abstractions around the HTTP Request and Response we discussed in chapter 2.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/06-dynamic-web-servers/04-custom-servers/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
