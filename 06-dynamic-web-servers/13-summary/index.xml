We also learned how dynamic webservers can handle data and file uploads from HTML forms, as well as some security concerns involved. We also saw how state can be introduced to web apps using cookies and sessions.
In the next few chapters, weâ€™ll explore these ideas in more detail.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/06-dynamic-web-servers/13-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
