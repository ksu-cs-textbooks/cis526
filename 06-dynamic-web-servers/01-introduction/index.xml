A key realization here is that the resources served by the web server don’t need to exist to be served.
Consider the directory listing from the previous chapter. It is not based on an existing file, but rather is dynamically created when requested by querying the file system of the server. This brings one clear benefit - if we add files to the directory, the next time we request the listing they will be included.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/06-dynamic-web-servers/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
