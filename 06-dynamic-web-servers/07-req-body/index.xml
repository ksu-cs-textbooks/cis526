It constructs and passes the http.IncomingMessage and http.ServerResponse objects as soon as it has received the header portion of the request. This means the body may still be being transmitted to the server as you start to process the request.
This is fine for GET requests, as they don’t have a body.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/06-dynamic-web-servers/07-req-body/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
