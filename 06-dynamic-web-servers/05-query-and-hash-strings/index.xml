The Hash String First, let’s briefly visit the hash string. It’s traditional use is to indicate a HTML element on the page the browser should scroll to when visiting the URL. When used this way, its value is the id attribute of the element. The browser will automatically scroll to a position that displays the element on-screen. Thus, the traditional use of the hash string is for “bookmarked” links that take you to an exact section of the page, like this one which takes you to a description of your personal CS web space: https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/Personal_Web_Pages#Dynamic_Content.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/06-dynamic-web-servers/05-query-and-hash-strings/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
