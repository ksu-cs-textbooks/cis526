One popular Node library express, is at its heart a router. If we were to write our Node blog using Express, the syntax to create our routes would be:
const express = require('express'); var app = express(); // Home page app.get('/', serveHome); // Posts app.get('posts/', servePosts); app.get('posts/:id', servePost); app.post('posts/', createPost); app.post('posts/:id', updatePost); app.delete('posts/:id', deletePost); // Comments app.get('posts/:post_id/comments', servePosts); app.get('posts/:post_id/comments/:id', servePost); app.post('posts/:post_id/comments', createPost); app.post('posts/:post_id/comments/:id', updatePost); app.delete('posts/:post_id/comments/:id', deletePost); module.exports = app; The app variable is an instance of the express Application class, which itself is a wrapper around Node’s http.Server class. The Express Application adds (among other features), routing using the route methods app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), and app.delete(). These take routes either in string or regular expression form, and the wildcard values are assigned to an object in req.params. For example, we might write our servePost() method as:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/08-routing/06-routers/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
