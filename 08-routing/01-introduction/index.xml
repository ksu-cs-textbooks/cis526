We revisit this diagram because it is so central to how HTTP servers work. At the heart, a server’s primary responsibility is to respond to an incoming request. Thus, in writing a web server, our primary task is to determine what to respond with. With static web servers, the answer is pretty simple - we map the virtual path supplied by the URL to a file path on the file server. But the URL supplied in a request doesn’t have to correspond to any real object on the server - we can create any object we want, and send it back.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/08-routing/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
