An API is simply a interface for two programs to communicate, to allow one to act as a service for the other. Web APIs are APIs that use hyper-text transfer protocol (http) as the mechanism for this communication. Thus, the client program makes HTTP requests against the API server and receives responses. The Placeholder.com we discussed earlier in this chapter is an example of a web API - one that generates and serves placeholder images.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/08-routing/07-apis/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
