These operations are so pervasive in database systems that we have an acronym for them: CRUD.</p><p>Roy mapped these CRUD methods to a HTTP URL + Method pattern he called <strong>Re</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>T</strong>ransfer (or REST). This pattern provided a well-defined way to express CRUD operations as HTTP requests.</p><p>Take our blog posts example. The RESTful routes associated with posts would be:</p><table><tr><th>URL</th><th>HTTP Method</th><th>CRUD Operation</th></tr><tr><td>posts/</td><td>GET</td><td>Read (all)</td></tr><tr><td>posts/:id</td><td>GET</td><td>Read (one)</td></tr><tr><td>posts/</td><td>POST</td><td>Create</td></tr><tr><td>posts/:id</td><td>POST</td><td>Update</td></td><tr><td>posts/:id</td><td>DELETE</td><td>Delete</td></tr></table><p>The <code>:id</code> corresponds to an actual identifier of a specific resource - most often the <code>id</code> column in the database. REST also accounts for nesting relationships. Consider if we added <em>comments</em> to our <em>posts</em>. Comments would need to correspond to a specific post, so we&rsquo;d nest the routes:</p><table><tr><th>URL</th><th>HTTP Method</th><th>CRUD Operation</th></tr><tr><td>posts/:post_id/comments</td><td>GET</td><td>Read (all)</td></tr><tr><td>posts/:post_id/comments/:comment_id</td><td>GET</td><td>Read (one)</td></tr><tr><td>posts/:post_id/comments</td><td>POST</td><td>Create</td></tr><tr><td>posts/:post_id/comments/:comments_id</td><td>POST</td><td>Update</td></td><tr><td>posts/:post_id/comments/:comments_id</td><td>DELETE</td><td>Delete</td></tr></table><p>Notice that we now have <em>two</em> wildcards for most routes, one corresponding to the <code>post</code> and one to the <code>comment</code>.</p><p>If we didn&rsquo;t want to support an operation, for example, <em>updating</em> comments, we could just omit that route.</p><p>REST was so straightforward and corresponded so well to how many web servers were operating, that it quickly became a widely adopted technique in the web world. When you hear of a RESTful API or RESTful routes, we are referring to using this pattern in the URLs of a site.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis526/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1755561291 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1755561291 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/theme.min.js?1755561291 defer></script></div><script src=/cis526/js/tele-scroll.min.js?1755561291 defer></script></body></html>
