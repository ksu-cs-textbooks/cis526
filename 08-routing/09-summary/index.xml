Routes typically consist of both the request URL and the request method. RESTful routes provide a common strategy for implementing CRUD methods for a server-generated resource; any programmer familiar with REST will quickly be able to suss out the appropriate route.
We also explored routers are objects that make routing more manageable to implement. These allow you to define a route and tie it to an endpoint function used to generate the result. Most will also capture wildcards in the route, and supply those to the endpoint function in some form. We briefly looked at the Express framework, a Node framework that adds a router to the vanilla Node http.Server class.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/08-routing/09-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
