It should be obvious therefore that one-size-fits-all approach to laying out web applications does not work well. Instead, the current best practice is a technique known as Responsive Web Design. When using this strategy your web app should automatically adjust the layout of the page based on how large the device screen it is rendered on.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/b-css/14-responsive-web-design/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
