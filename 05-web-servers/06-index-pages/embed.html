Clicking on a file will open or download it, and clicking a directory will open <em>that</em> directory&rsquo;s auto-generated directory listing.</p><p>As the use of the web expanded into commercial and public life, many web developers wanted to replace auto-generated directory listing pages with a carefully designed home page. But auto-generated directory listing pages remained an important feature for many sites that served as a more traditional file server.</p><p>The compromise adopted by most web servers was that if the directory contained an HTML file named <em>index.html</em> (or sometimes <em>index</em> with any extension, i.e. <em>index.php</em>), that page would be served in leu of an auto-generated index page. Most also allow disabling the directory listing as a configuration option.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices info"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i>
Info</summary><div class=box-content><p>You might be wondering about security if a web server starts exposing directory structure and files willy-nilly. Most web servers will <em>only</em> serve files in a specific directory (often called the <em>root</em> directory) and its subdirectories. In a typical configuration, this root directory is named <em>public</em> or <em>public_html</em> to reinforce the idea that it is available to anyone browsing the web.</p><p>Files that need to have access restricted to certain people should not be placed in this directory, but be placed behind an authentication mechanism (sometimes referred to as an <em>auth wall</em> or <em>pay wall</em> for subscription-based sites). We&rsquo;ll talk about this more in our chapter on authentication.</p></div></details><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis526/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1769117712 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1769117712 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/theme.min.js?1769117712 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/embed-iframe.min.js?1769117712 defer></script></body></html>
