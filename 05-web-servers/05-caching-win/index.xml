But even when it doesn’t block, it can still take a lot of time, making it the most expensive part of our request handling operation in terms of the time it takes to perform.
If we really want to squeeze all the performance we can out of our server (and therefore handle as many users as possible), we need to consider the strategy of caching. This means storing our file content in a location where access is faster - say in memory rather than on the disk. Variables in our application are stored in RAM, even variables whose contents were initialized from disk files. Thus, assigning the contents of a file to a variable effectively caches it for faster access.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/05-web-servers/05-caching-win/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
