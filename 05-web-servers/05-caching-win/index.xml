But even when it doesnâ€™t block, it can still take a lot of time, making it the most expensive part of our request handling operation in terms of the time it takes to perform.
If we really want to squeeze all the performance we can out of our server (and therefore handle as many users as possible), we need to consider the strategy of caching.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/05-web-servers/05-caching-win/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
