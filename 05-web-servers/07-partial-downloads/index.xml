One case is with a large file download that gets interrupted - it makes a lot of sense to start downloading the remaining bytes from where you left off, rather than starting over again. A second case is when you are streaming media; often the user may not watch or listen to the entire media file, so why download the bytes they don’t need? Or if it is a live stream, we explicitly can’t download the entire thing, because later parts do not yet exist!</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/05-web-servers/07-partial-downloads/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
