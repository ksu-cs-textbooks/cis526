A unit of work that can be done in parallel is split off and handed to another thread, and any data it needs is copied into that threadsâ€™ memory space. When the work is complete, the second thread notifies the primary thread if the work was completed successfully or not, and provides the resulting data or error.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/03-asynchronous-js/04-asynchronous-programming/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
