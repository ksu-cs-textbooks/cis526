class=headline></header><h1 id=introduction>Introduction</h1><p>JavaScript makes extensive use of asynchronous processing to tackle the challenge of concurrency. This includes the events we&rsquo;ve already talked about (user events, network events and timers), but it has also been expanded to provide even more powerful features. The XMLHTTPRequest object allows JavaScript to request additional resources directly in an asynchronous manner, and the more recent Fetch API updates that approach. Web workers allow parallel JavaScript processes to be run in the browser. And new ES6 syntax and constructs like Promises and the async/await keywords make asynchronous functions easier to reason about and use. In this chapter, we will explore each of these topics.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=concurrency-approaches>Concurrency Approaches</h1><p>Concurrency means &ldquo;doing more than one thing at the same time.&rdquo; In computer science, concurrency can refer to (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science) rel=external target=_blank>1</a>) structuring a program or algorithm so that it can be executed out-of-order or in partial order, or (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing rel=external target=_blank>2</a>) actually executing computations in parallel. In modern-day programming, we&rsquo;re often talking about <em>both</em>. But to help us develop a stronger understanding, let&rsquo;s look at the two ideas one-at-a-time, and then bring it together.</p><h2 id=concurrency>Concurrency</h2><p>One of the earliest concurrency problems computer science dealt with was the efficient use of early computers. Consider a mainframe computer like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1 rel=external target=_blank>PDP-1</a>, once a staple of the university computer science department. In 1963, the base price of a PDP-1 was $120,000. Adjusted for inflation, this would be a price of a bit more than <em>one million dollars</em> in 2020! That&rsquo;s a pretty big investment! Any institution, be it a university, a corporation, or a government agency that spent that kind of money would want to use their new computer as efficiently as possible.</p><p>Consider when you are working on a math assignment and using a calculator. You probably read your problem carefully, write out an equation on paper, and then type a few calculations into your calculator, and copy the results to your paper. You might write a few lines as you progress through solving the problem, then punch a new calculation into your calculator. Between computations, your calculator is sitting idle - not doing anything. Mainframe computers worked much the same way - you loaded a program, it ran, and spat out results. Until you loaded a new program, the mainframe would be idle.</p><h3 id=batch-processing>Batch Processing</h3><p>An early solution was the use of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing rel=external target=_blank>batch processing</a>, where programs were prepared ahead of time on punch-card machines or the like, and turned over to an IT department team that would then feed these programs into the computer. In this way, the IT staff could keep the computer working as long as there was batched work to do. While this approach kept the computer busy, it was not ideal for the programmers. Consider the calculator example - it would be as if you had to write out your calculations and give them to another person to enter into the calculator. And they might not get you your results for days!</p><p>Can you imagine trying to write a program that way? In the early days that was <em>exactly</em> how CS students wrote programs - they would write an entire program on punch cards, turn it in to the computer staff to be batched, and get the results once it had been run. If they made a mistake, it would require another full round of typing cards, turning them in, and waiting for results!</p><p>Batch processing is still used for some kinds of systems - such as the generation of your DARS report at K-State, for sending email campaigns, and for running jobs on Beocat and other supercomputers. However, in mainframe operations it quickly was displaced by <em>time sharing</em>.</p><h3 id=time-sharing>Time Sharing</h3><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing rel=external target=_blank>Time-sharing</a> is an approach that has much in common with its real-estate equivalent that shares its name. In real estate, a time-share is a vacation property that is owned by multiple people, who take turns using it. In a mainframe computer system, a time sharing approach likewise means that multiple people share a single computer. In this approach, terminals (a monitor and keyboard) are hooked up to the mainframe. But there is one important difference between time-sharing real estate and computers, which is why we can call this approach <em>concurrent</em>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s return to the example of the calculator. In the moments between your typing an expression and reading the results, another student could type in their expression, and get their results. A time-sharing mainframe does exactly that - it take a few fractions of a second to advance each users&rsquo; program, switching between different users at lightning speed. Consider a newspaper where twenty people might we writing stories at a given moment - each terminal would capture key presses, and send them to the mainframe when it gave its attention, which would update the text editor, and send the resulting screen data back to the terminal. To the individual users, it would appear the computer was only working with them. But in actuality it was updating all twenty text editor program instances in real-time (at least to human perception).</p><p>Like batch processing, time-sharing is still used in computing today. If you&rsquo;ve used the thin clients in the DUE 1114 lab, these are the current-day equivalents of those early terminals. They&rsquo;re basically a video card, monitor, and input device that are hooked up to a server that runs multiple VMs (virtual machines), one for each client, and switches between them constantly updating each.</p><h3 id=multitasking>Multitasking</h3><p>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer rel=external target=_blank>microcomputer revolution</a> did not do away with the concept. Rather, modern operating systems still use the basic concept of the approach, though in the context of a single computer it is known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking rel=external target=_blank>multitasking</a>. When you write a paper now, your operating system is switching between processes in much the same way that time-sharing switched between users. It will switch to your text editor, processing your last keystroke and updating the text on screen. Then it will shift to your music player and stream the next few thousand bytes of the song you&rsquo;re listening to the sound card. Then it will switch to your email program which checks the email server and it will start to notify you that a new email has come in. Then it will switch back to your text editor.</p><p>The thin clients in DUE 1114 (as well as the remote desktops) are therefore both time-sharing between VMs and multitasking within VMs.</p><h2 id=parallel-processing>Parallel Processing</h2><p>The second approach to concurrency involves using <em>multiple</em> computers in parallel. K-State&rsquo;s <a href="https://support.beocat.ksu.edu/BeocatDocs/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel=external target=_blank>Beocat</a> is a good example of this - a supercomputer built of a lot of individual computers. But your laptop or desktop likely is as well; if you have a multi-core CPU, you actually have multiple processors built into your CPU, and each can run separate computational processes. This, it is entirely possible that as you are writing your term paper the text editor is running on one processor, your email application is using a second one, and your music is running on a third.</p><p>In fact, modern operating systems use both multitasking and parallel processing in tandem, spreading out the work to do across however many cores are available, and swapping between active processes to on those cores. Some programs also organize their own computation to run on multiple processors - your text editor might actually be handling your input on one core, running a spellcheck on a second, and a grammar check on a third.</p><p>Remember our earlier discussion about scaling web servers? This is <em>also</em> a parallel processing approach. Incoming HTTP requests are directed by a load balancer to a less-busy server, and that server formulates the response.</p><p><a href=#R-image-98198a066cfc60e7697dcb0729db2760 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Horizontal Scaling" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis526/images/3.2.1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

We typically call this approach <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Multithreading rel=external target=_blank>Multithreading</a>, and the individually executing portions of the program code <em>threads</em>.</p><p>These aren&rsquo;t the only ways to approach concurrency, but they are ones we commonly see in practice. Before we turn our attention to how asynchronous processes fit in though, we&rsquo;ll want to discuss some of the challenges that concurrency brings.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=concurrency-challenges>Concurrency Challenges</h1><p>Implementing concurrency in computing systems comes with some specific challenges. Consider the multitasking approach where we have your text editor and your music player running at the same time. As the text editor process yields to the music player, the data and program elements it had loaded up into working memory, needs to be cleared out and replaced with the music player&rsquo;s data and program. However, the music player&rsquo;s data and program need to be retained <em>somewhere</em> so that they can be swapped back in when the music player yields.</p><p>Modern operating systems handle this challenge by dividing working memory amongst all programs running (which is why the more programs you run, the more RAM you consume). Each running process is assigned a block of memory and <em>only</em> allowed to use that memory. Moreover, data copied into the CPU (the L2 cache, L1 cache, and registers) may also be cached in memory for later restoration. You&rsquo;ll learn more about the details of this process if you take an Operating Systems course. But it is <em>very</em> important that each running program is <em>only</em> allowed to make changes in its own assigned memory space. If it wasn&rsquo;t, it could overwrite the data of another task!</p><details open class="box cstyle notices info"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i>
Info</summary><div class=box-content><p>In fact, an OS allowing a running program to overwrite another program&rsquo;s assigned memory is a <em>security vulnerability</em>, as this can involve overwriting part of the other <em>program</em>, changing how it actually works! Viruses, trojans, and worms are often written to exploit this kind of vulnerability.</p></div></details><p>While operating systems normally manage the challenges of concurrency between running programs, when the program <em>itself</em> is written to be concurrent, the program itself must be built to avoid accidentally overwriting its own memory in unexpected ways. Consider a text editor - it might have its main thread handling user input, and a second thread handling spell checking. Now the user has typed &ldquo;A quick brow&rdquo;, and the spell checker is finding that &ldquo;brow&rdquo; is misspelled. It might try to underline the line in red, but in the intervening time, the user has deleted &ldquo;brow&rdquo;, so the underlining is no longer valid!</p><p>Or consider image data. Applying a filter to an image is a computationally costly operation - typically requiring visiting each pixel in the image, and for some filters, visiting each pixel <em>around</em> each pixel as part of the transformation. This would be a good use-case for multi-threading. But now imagine <em>two</em> filters working in parallel. One might be applying a blur, and the other a grayscale transformation. If they were overwriting the old image data with their new filtered version, and were working at the same time, they might both start from the original pixels in the upper-right-hand corner. The blur would take longer, as it needs to visit neighboring pixels. So the grayscale filter writes out the first hundred pixels, and then the blur writes out its first hundred, over-writing the grayed pixels with blurred color pixels. Eventually, the grayscale filter will get so far ahead of the blur filter that the blur filter will be reading in now-greyed out pixels, and blurring them. The result could well be a mishmash of blurred color and gray-and-white splotches.</p><p>There are many different approaches that can be used to manage this challenge. One is the use of locks - locking a section of memory so only one thread can access it while it makes changes. In the filter example, the grayscale filter could lock the image data, forcing the blur filter to wait until it finishes. Locks work well, but must be carefully designed to avoid race conditions - where two threads cannot move forward because the other thread has already locked a resource the blocked thread needs to finish its work.</p><p>Asynchronous programming is another potential solution, which we&rsquo;ll look at next.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=asynchronous-programming>Asynchronous Programming</h1><p>In asynchronous programming, memory collisions are avoided by not sharing memory between threads. A unit of work that can be done in parallel is split off and handed to another thread, and any data it needs is copied into that threads&rsquo; memory space. When the work is complete, the second thread notifies the primary thread if the work was completed successfully or not, and provides the resulting data or error.</p><p>In JavaScript, this notification is pushed into the event queue, and the main thread processes it when the event loop pulls the result off the event queue. Thus, the only memory that is shared between the code you&rsquo;ve written in the Event Loop and the code running in the asynchronous process is the memory invovled in the event queue. Keeping this memory thread-safe is managed by the JavaScript interpreter. Thus, the code you write (which runs in the Event Loop) is essentially single-threaded, even if your JavaScript application is using some form of parallel processing!</p><p>Let&rsquo;s reconsider a topic we&rsquo;ve already discussed with this new understanding - timers. When we invoke <code>setTimer()</code>, we are creating a timer that is managed asynchronously. When the timer elapses, it creates a timer &rsquo;event&rsquo; and adds it to the event queue. We can see this in the diagram below.</p><p><a href=#R-image-393ff577bbc8a74fd3011fcd21332f86 class=lightbox-link><img alt="The timer and event loop" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis526/images/3.4.1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-393ff577bbc8a74fd3011fcd21332f86><img alt="The timer and event loop" class="border lazy lightbox lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis526/images/3.4.1.png></a></p><p>However, the timer is not actually an <em>event</em>, in the same sense that a <code>'click'</code> or <code>'keydown'</code> event is&mldr; in that those events are provided to the browser from the operating system, and the browser passes them along into the JavaScript interpreter, possibly with some transformation. In contrast, the timer is created from within the JavaScript code, though its triggering is managed asynchronously.</p><p>In fact, both timers and events represent this style of asynchronous processing - both are managed by creating <em>messages</em> that are placed on the event queue to be processed by the interpreter. But the timer provides an important example of how asynchronous programming works. Consider this code that creates a timer that triggers after 0 milliseconds:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#a6e22e>setTimeout</span>(()=&gt;{
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#a6e22e>console</span>.<span style=color:#a6e22e>log</span>(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Timer expired!&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>}, <span style=color:#ae81ff>0</span>);
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#a6e22e>console</span>.<span style=color:#a6e22e>log</span>(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;I just set a timer.&#34;</span>);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What will be printed first? The &ldquo;Timer expired!&rdquo; message or the &ldquo;I just set a timer.&rdquo; message?</p><p>See for yourself - try running this code in the console (you can click the &ldquo;console&rdquo; tab below to open it).</p><p>The answer is that &ldquo;I just set a timer&rdquo; will <em>always</em> be printed first, because the second message won&rsquo;t be printed until the event loop pulls the timer message off the queue, and the line printing &ldquo;I just set a timer&rdquo; is executed as part of this pass in the event loop. The <code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code> functions are what we call <em>asynchronous</em> functions, as they trigger an asynchronous process. Once that process is triggered, execution immediately continues within the event loop, while the triggered process runs in parallel.

When the JavaScript interpreter is working on a big task, it stays in the event loop a long time, and does not pull events from the event queue. The result is the browser stops responding to user events&mldr; and seems to be frozen. On the other hand - some programs will <em>never</em> end. Consider this one:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>while</span>(<span style=color:#66d9ef>true</span>) {
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#a6e22e>console</span>.<span style=color:#a6e22e>log</span>(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;thinking...&#34;</span>);
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This loop has no possible exit condition, so if you ran it in the browser, it would run infinitely long&mldr; and the page would never respond to user input, because you&rsquo;d never pull any events of the event queue. One of the important discoveries in computer science, the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem rel=external target=_blank>Halting Problem</a> tackles exactly this issue - and Alan Turing&rsquo;s proof shows that a program to determine if another program will halt for all possible programs <em>cannot</em> be written.</p><p>Thus, browsers instead post warning messages after execution has run for a significant amount of time, like this one:</p><p><a href=#R-image-66bd7a6d455858df223050b0d721d10e class=lightbox-link><img alt="The Chrome not responding dialog" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis526/images/3.5.1.jpg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers rel=external target=_blank>web worker</a> provides just this functionality.</p><p>A web worker is essentially another JavaScript interpreter, running a script separate from the main thread. As an interpreter, it has its own event loop and its own memory space. Workers and the main thread can communicate by passing messages, which are copied onto their respective event queues. Thus, communication between the threads is <em>asynchronous</em>.</p><p><a href=#R-image-0d8e68fb314de1449a64f9cbc94b0434 class=lightbox-link><img alt="The web worker and main thread interpreters passing messages" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis526/images/3.5.2.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

This example simulates a long-running process of <strong>n</strong> seconds either in the browser&rsquo;s main thread or in a web worker. On the page is also three colored squares that when clicked, shift colors. Try changing the colors of the squares while simulating a several-second process in both ways. See how running the process on the main thread freezes the user interface?</p><h2 id=using-web-workers>Using Web Workers</h2><p>Web workers are actually very easy to use. A web worker is created by constructing a <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker rel=external target=_blank>Worker</a> object. It takes a single argument - the JavaScript file it will execute (which should be hosted on the same server). In the example, this is done with:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e>// Set up the web worker

It has two events:</p><ul><li><code>message</code> - a deserialized message sent from the web worker</li><li><code>mesageerror</code> - a message sent from the web worker that was not serializable</li></ul><p>You can use <code>worker.addEventListener()</code> to add these, or you can assign your event listener to the event handler properties. Those properties are:</p><ul><li><code>Worker.onmessage</code> - triggered when the <code>message</code> event happens</li><li><code>Worker.onmessageerror</code> - triggered when the <code>messageerror</code> event happens</li></ul><p>Additionally, there is an error handler property:</p><ul><li><code>Worker.onerror</code></li></ul><p>Which triggers when an uncaught error occurs on the web worker.</p><p>In our example, we listen for messages using the <code>Worker.onmessage</code> property:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e>// Set up message listener

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the message was successfully deserialized, it&rsquo;s <code>data</code> property contains the content of the message, which can be any valid JavaScript value (an int, string, array, object, etc). This gives us a great deal of flexibility. If you need to send more than one type of message, a common strategy is to send a JavaScript object with a type property, and additional properties as needed, i.e.:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>var</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>messageData1</span> <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> {

We can also optionally <em>transfer</em> objects to the web worker instead of copying them by providing them as a second argument. This transfers the memory holding them from one thread to the other. This makes them unavailable on the original thread, but is much faster than copying when the object is large. It is used for sending objects like <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ArrayBuffer rel=external target=_blank>ArrayBuffer</a>, <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessagePort rel=external target=_blank>MessagePort</a>, or <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageBitmap rel=external target=_blank>ImageBitmap</a>. Transferred objects <em>also</em> need to have a reference in the first argument.</p><h2 id=the-web-worker-context>The Web Worker Context</h2><p>For the JavaScript executing in the web worker, the context is a bit different. First, there is no document object model, as the web worker cannot make changes to the user interface. Likewise there is no global <code>window</code> object. However, many of the normal global functions and properties <em>not</em> related to the user interface are available, see <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers rel=external target=_blank>functions and classes available to web workers</a> for details.</p><p>The web worker has its own unique global scope, so any variables declared in your main thread won&rsquo;t exist here. Likewise, varibles declared in the worker will not exist in the main scope either. The global scope of the worker has mirror events and properties to the <code>Worker</code> - we can listen for messages from the main thread using the <code>onmessage</code> and <code>onmessageerror</code> properties, and send messages back to the main thread with <code>postMessage()</code>.</p><p>The complete web worker script from the example is:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e>/** @function stall

You can think of it as a state machine that is in one of three states: <em>pending</em>, <em>fulfilled</em>, or <em>rejected</em>.</p><p>A promise can be created by wrapping an asynchronous call within a new <code>Promise</code> object. For example, we can turn a <code>setTimeout()</code> into a promise with:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>var</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>threeSecondPromise</span> <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>new</span> Promise((<span style=color:#a6e22e>resolve</span>, <span style=color:#a6e22e>reject</span>) =&gt; {

However, the actual execution model it is <em>still</em> the event-based concurrency that we introduced with callbacks. Thus, when awaiting a result, the JavaScript interpreter is free to process other incoming events pulled off the event loop.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=summary>Summary</h1><p>In this chapter we learned about many of the approaches and challenges involved in concurrent programming, including <em>asynchronous</em> programming. JavaScript adopts the asynchronous approach through its use of the event loop and queue, allowing asynchronous processes to be invoked, processed on separate threads, and posting their results as new messages on the event queue to be processed when the main thread gets to them.</p><p>We saw how this approach allows for multi-threaded programs in the browser through the use of web workers, each of which runs a separate JavaScript interpreter with its own event loop and queue. We also saw how communication between web workers and the main thread are handled through message passing, and how very large data buffers can be transferred instead of copied between these threads for efficiency.</p><p>Finally, we examined the callback mechanism used for asynchronous processing in JavaScript, and explored two common abstractions used to make it more programmer-friendly: promises and the async/await keywords.</p><p>In the next chapter, we&rsquo;ll explore Node.js, a server-side implementation of the JavaScript engine that makes heavy use of the JavaScript asynchronous model.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></section></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>8.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
