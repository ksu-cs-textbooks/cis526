But when Netscape cut a deal with Sun Microsystems to bring Java Applets to their browser, his mission was altered to create a more Java-like langauge. He developed a prototype in only ten days, that blended <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) rel=external target=_blank>Java</a> syntax, the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language) rel=external target=_blank>Self</a> object-orientation approach, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language) rel=external target=_blank>Scheme</a> functionality.</p><p>Netscape eventually submitted JavaScript to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International rel=external target=_blank>ECMA International</a>, resulting in the ECMAScript standard, and opening the door for other browsers to adopt JavaScript. Currently all major browsers support the full ECMAScript 5 standard, and large chunks of ECMAScript 6 and some parts of later versions as well. Moreover, <em>transpilation</em> can be utilized to make newer ECMAScript-compliant code run on older browser versions.</p><div class="box notices cstyle info"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div><div class=box-content><p>The ECMA standard is maintained by <a href=https://www.ecma-international.org/ rel=external target=_blank>ECMA International</a>, not the W3C.
