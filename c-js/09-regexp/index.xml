"foobarwhen".includes("bar")would evaluate to true. But what if you needed a more general solution? Say, to see if the text matched a phone number pattern like XXX-XXX-XXXX? Thatâ€™s where Regular Expressions come in.
Regular Expressions are a sequence of characters that define a pattern that can be searched for within a string.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/c-js/09-regexp/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
