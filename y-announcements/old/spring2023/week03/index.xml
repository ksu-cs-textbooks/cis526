This week you should have milestone one completed it was due yesterday. So hopefully you’ve got that turned in. If not, please make sure you do that as soon as you can. This week, you’ll be working on the lessons for the week two module in Canvas. And then the following week, you’ll have a week to work on the second milestone, which is due Monday, February the 13th. So the first milestone that will take care of grading this week, basically look for code comments in GitHub. And then I’ll also leave some comments in Canvas as well. If you have any comments that you want to leave for me, you can use submission comments in Canvas, or you can make release notes in GitHub for that, it may take me a little while to go through this milestone just because I really want to come through the code and make sure everything’s looking good. So please be a little patient as I go through the milestone grading. But hopefully it should be done within a week of you getting it submitted. So watch for that. And you’ll see those comments coming through on GitHub and on Canvas as soon as I get that done.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/spring2023/week03/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
