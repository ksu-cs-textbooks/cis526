Hello, and welcome to the week one announcements video for CC 515 in spring 2023. My name is Russell Feldhausen. And Iâ€™ll be your instructor this semester. My contact information is here in the slide, you can also find it on canvas and you can find it on the syllabus. The big thing to be aware of is I mostly work remotely from my home in Shawnee, Kansas, which is near Kansas City.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/spring2023/week01/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
