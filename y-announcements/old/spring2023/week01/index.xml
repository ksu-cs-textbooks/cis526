Hello, and welcome to the week one announcements video for CC 515 in spring 2023. My name is Russell Feldhausen. And I’ll be your instructor this semester. My contact information is here in the slide, you can also find it on canvas and you can find it on the syllabus. The big thing to be aware of is I mostly work remotely from my home in Shawnee, Kansas, which is near Kansas City. But I am on Campus, usually every Monday, this semester, most of you may be remote as well. And that’s fine, I’ll mostly meet with you via zoom, it should be pretty easy. You can contact me the easiest way to get me as russfeld@ksu.edu. But I also exist on the CS Discord server and on K State instance of Microsoft Teams, so you can find me there as well.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/spring2023/week01/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
