This week you should be wrapping up work on Milestone Two that was due yesterday. So hopefully you’ve got that done and turned in this week, you should start in on the week three lessons. The week three lessons will go for this week and next week and in milestone three is due in two weeks on February 27. So milestone grading, I will try and work on grading milestone three this week, or Milestone Two, sorry, please look for code comments and GitHub. This is one that I tend to leave quite a few comments on about code style and structure, you can always use your submission comments in Canvas, or you can use release notes and GitHub to send me any information I need to use. Please be patient, it does take me a while to get to grading this class, I know that there’s only a few students. But we’ve got a lot of things going on this semester. So I will try and get to you as soon as I can. But please look for those code comments. I’ll try and give you good feedback to help you out so you can improve for the future milestones.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/spring2023/week05/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
