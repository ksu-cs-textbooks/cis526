So you should have completed milestone for last week. So hopefully that’s going well, this week. And next week, you’ll be working on the week six lessons in Canvas, which does a lot of different things. And then you’ll have milestone five, which is due April 24.
So the week six lessons allow us to build out our web framework a little bit more deeply, we’re going to add a lot of features to our web framework, including authentication, we’re going to add interacting with some web API’s, we’re going to learn about web hooks and formal web frameworks.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/spring2023/week12/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
