This week you should be wrapping up milestone three, which is due tonight. So make sure you get that submitted online. And then this coming week, you’ll be working on the week four lessons. There is no milestone due this coming week, because partially we have the Fourth of July holiday on Monday. And also partially because we’ve got a lot of content to cover. So you really have two weeks of content before the next milestone, and we’ll talk about that in just a second.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week04/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
