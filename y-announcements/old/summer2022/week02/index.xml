So this week, you should be wrapping up milestone one, which is due tonight by midnight. So make sure you get that turned in and submitted, you’ll be submitting it via GitHub. So you’ll actually post your code to GitHub classroom, make sure you make a release tag or something there. And then in Canvas, you will submit that you can also submit your Codio we’ll be doing it that way as well. So there’s a couple of different places I’ll be able to find your code, but hopefully it is both in GitHub, and in Codio that I can find it. This Friday week two lessons are due, there’s four or five different interactive lessons this week. So make sure you work on those maybe set a goal to do one per day to get those lessons done by Friday. And then next Monday will be Milestone Two, which we’ll talk about here shortly.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week02/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
