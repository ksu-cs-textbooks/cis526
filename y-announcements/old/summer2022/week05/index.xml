So this week, you should be working on week five, which is the second of a two week series that leads up toward milestone four, where we really shift our focus from static websites and a little bit of Ajax in the browser to full on dynamic websites using Express and all sorts of things around that. So it’s a big shift, it’s a two week milestone. So make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get working on this milestone. A big hint for me is if you start milestone four on Monday, you’re probably not going to get it done and turn it in yet that day, it is quite a bigger project than the last few milestones.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week05/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
