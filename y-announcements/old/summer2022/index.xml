These announcements videos are going to be a little bit more unscripted than what you’re used to. So please bear with me as I work through all this content. My name is Russell Feldhausen. And I’ll be your instructor for this semester. My contact information is shown here. It’s also on the syllabus, it’s on the canvas homepage, it’s very many places. If you have any questions, you can email me my email is russfeld@ksu.edu. Email is generally my preferred method of communication if you need to chat with me directly. But as I’ll talk about in just a second, we’ll most likely use discord for most things in this course.</description></item><item><title>Summer '22 Week 2</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week02/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week02/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week two announcements for CIS 526 and CC 515, in summer 2022. So this week, you should be wrapping up milestone one, which is due tonight by midnight. So make sure you get that turned in and submitted, you’ll be submitting it via GitHub. So you’ll actually post your code to GitHub classroom, make sure you make a release tag or something there. And then in Canvas, you will submit that you can also submit your Codio we’ll be doing it that way as well. So there’s a couple of different places I’ll be able to find your code, but hopefully it is both in GitHub, and in Codio that I can find it. This Friday week two lessons are due, there’s four or five different interactive lessons this week. So make sure you work on those maybe set a goal to do one per day to get those lessons done by Friday. And then next Monday will be Milestone Two, which we’ll talk about here shortly.</description></item><item><title>Summer '22 Week 3</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week03/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week03/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week three announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515 in summer 2022.

This week you should be wrapping up milestone three, which is due tonight. So make sure you get that submitted online. And then this coming week, you’ll be working on the week four lessons. There is no milestone due this coming week, because partially we have the Fourth of July holiday on Monday. And also partially because we’ve got a lot of content to cover. So you really have two weeks of content before the next milestone, and we’ll talk about that in just a second.</description></item><item><title>Summer '22 Week 5</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week05/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week05/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week five announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515, in summer 2022. So this week, you should be working on week five, which is the second of a two week series that leads up toward milestone four, where we really shift our focus from static websites and a little bit of Ajax in the browser to full on dynamic websites using Express and all sorts of things around that. So it’s a big shift, it’s a two week milestone. So make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get working on this milestone. A big hint for me is if you start milestone four on Monday, you’re probably not going to get it done and turn it in yet that day, it is quite a bigger project than the last few milestones.</description></item><item><title>Summer '22 Week 6</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week06/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week06/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week six Announcements video for CIS 527 and CC 515 in summer 2022.

And then next Friday is when milestone six is due. However, I highly encourage you to finish the week seven and eight lessons soon, so that you can start working on milestone six, because it is quite a bit larger than the other milestones, as we’ll talk about in just a second.</description></item><item><title>Summer '22 Week 8</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week08/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week08/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week eight announcements videos for CIS 526 and CC 515 in summer 2022.
