These announcements videos are going to be a little bit more unscripted than what you’re used to. So please bear with me as I work through all this content. My name is Russell Feldhausen. And I’ll be your instructor for this semester. My contact information is shown here. It’s also on the syllabus, it’s on the canvas homepage, it’s very many places. If you have any questions, you can email me my email is russfeld@ksu.edu. Email is generally my preferred method of communication if you need to chat with me directly. But as I’ll talk about in just a second, we’ll most likely use discord for most things in this course.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week01/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
