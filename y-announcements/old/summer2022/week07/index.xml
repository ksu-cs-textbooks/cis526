So this week, you shouldn’t be wrapping up milestone five, which is do today’s, so make sure you get that submitted. And then we’ve got basically the week seven and eight content is all that’s left in this class. So the lessons for that are due next Monday. So you’ve got a whole week to work on that. And then next Friday is when milestone six is due. However, I highly encourage you to finish the week seven and eight lessons soon, so that you can start working on milestone six, because it is quite a bit larger than the other milestones, as we’ll talk about in just a second.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week07/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
