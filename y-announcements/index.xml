So as we talked about last week, I’m kind of taking over this course from Dr. Bean, who’s going to be shifting over to cover another course for the rest of the semester. And so as part of that, one of the things I’ve been working on is a lot of new content for this course to introduce how you would actually build a RESTful API and a standalone single page front end application using some of the more industry standard techniques and practices. The early part of this class with Dr. Bean is really great because it shows you behind the scenes, the intricacies of how these things work. You get to build your own cookie parser, your own body parser. You build your own very low level handlers for a lot of these things. And so now we’re going to take a step up the food chain a little bit, and we’re going to rebuild some of these ideas using the standard stuff that Node and Express includes.</description></item><item><title>Spring '25 Week 9</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week09/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week09/index.html</guid><description>Video Script Hello, everybody, and welcome to the week nine announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515 in spring 2025. Not much new to add this week. Hopefully, everybody got started on the RESTful API starter over spring break, which was due yesterday. I see that several people have already submitted this. This project is pretty easy. All you really have to do is accept the GitHub classroom and then build the starter project following exactly through my videos. There’s maybe about an hour and a half to two hours worth of videos of me going through it. But I give you every single piece of code for this first one. This is mainly just a tutorial that you follow along to be able to build the starter project that we’re gonna work on from there. But it includes a lot of really good explanations of why I’m structuring the things the way I am. Gives you some interactive tutorials of how to add documentation and things to your code. So I think this is a really good thing just to see how one person would approach an express starter project.</description></item><item><title>Spring '25 Week 10</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week10/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week10/index.html</guid><description>Video Script Hello and welcome to the week 10 announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515 in spring 2025. So over spring break, we shifted over to a lot of the new content that I’ve been working on for the semester. And so I see a lot of you have already completed some of the content for weeks 8, 9 and 10, which is great. Hopefully if you’re keeping up in the class, the content for week nine adding a database was due yesterday. So I see quite a few of you have done that. And then the third part, adding an API and unit tests is due this week. This is one of the larger milestones just because of the number of unit tests that you’re going to add to your project. So I really encourage you to try and get the tutorial done as soon as you can so that you’ve got plenty of time to work on the API and unit tests. That’s due next Monday.</description></item><item><title>Spring '25 Week 11</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week11/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week11/index.html</guid><description>Video Script Hello and welcome to the week 11 announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515 in spring 2025. Over the weekend, I just published the materials for week 11 and week 12. So if you’re at that point and caught up, you can get started on that. Week 11 is going to add authentication to our RESTful API. So we’re going to add the ability to have background bypass authentication, as well as having CAS authentication, and we’re going to add role-based authorization to our project as well. So it’s a big change toward our backend. We’re also going to add a lot of unit tests for that to make sure all of our authorization and authentication is working properly.</description></item><item><title>Spring '25 Week 12</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week12/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week12/index.html</guid><description>Video Script Hello and welcome to the week 12 announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515 in spring 2025. I’ve got a few things I’m going to briefly cover this morning. First off, we have a guest speaker scheduled to come and talk to our class. This is going to be on Friday, April 25th at 2 o’clock p.m. Our speaker is Heather Pekrul. She is a front-end application architect at Garmin. She’s been working with the company for over nine years, and prior to that has a wide range of experience working in web development. She uses a lot of the tools and things that we have used in this class, including view and node. She was actually the one that got me started working in view and working with the prime view component framework. So Heather has a lot of experience that’s going to be very relevant to what you’ve been doing.</description></item><item><title>Spring '25 Week 13</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week13/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week13/index.html</guid><description>Video Script Hello and welcome to the week 13 announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515 in spring 2025. So this week you should be wrapping up the front-end part one for the Vue.js. This is just kind of a simple starter project tutorial without a milestone to get you started working in Vue. It gives you some of the basic concepts of working in a Vue front-end which is a little bit different than the React front-end we worked with earlier but a lot of the concepts are still the same. And then also don’t forget this week we have our guest speaker coming in so make sure you check out the announcement on Canvas for that.</description></item><item><title>Spring '25 Week 14</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week14/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week14/index.html</guid><description>Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week 14 announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515 in spring 2025. So we’re down here on week 14. So we’ve got some advanced topics on working with your RESTful API and view.js that you can take a look at. There’s a quick tutorial that you can run through. Mostly it’s just going through the stuff that I talk about in the textbook. Those advanced topics include using Pinia as a store to store data. We’ve kind of looked at Pinia a little bit but we haven’t dug into it too deeply. So this gives you another example for creating a Pinia store. We talk about ways that you can reuse components in your web app so that you can actually have these pop-up edit boxes that are really useful. And then the rest of the time we spend a lot of time talking about how to deploy your app using things like a Docker file, creating a Docker compose file to actually deploy it on a real server. And then we talk about the changes that you need to make to your application if you want to support an external database such as Postgres. And so what I want you to do is go through all these advanced topics, kind of get them working in your project and submit that.</description></item><item><title>Spring '25 Week 15</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week15/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week15/index.html</guid><description>Video Script Hello and welcome to the week 15 announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515 in spring 2025. So here we are, we’re at the last real week of the semester before finals week. Hopefully everybody was able to get through the advanced topics tutorial. Hopefully it worked really well. It’s a lot of stuff that I wanted to add at the end of the class, but didn’t really fit anywhere else. So it jumps around a little bit between some view topics and working with Docker and working with external databases. But I think it’s the last big pile of content I wanted you to get at the end of the semester. I have just published the final project, which you can find here on canvas. The final project links to a textbook page. Let me pull the textbook page over here real quick. So basically it has four different things I want you to do. I have not put together the rubric for these, but you can think of basically each one of these as roughly a quarter of the project. Some of them are going to be a little bit bigger than others, but hopefully you can get through those. And then I will actually show you my model solution.</description></item></channel></rss>
