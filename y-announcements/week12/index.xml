I’ve got a few things I’m going to briefly cover this morning. First off, we have a guest speaker scheduled to come and talk to our class. This is going to be on Friday, April 25th at 2 o’clock p.m. Our speaker is Heather Pekrul. She is a front-end application architect at Garmin. She’s been working with the company for over nine years, and prior to that has a wide range of experience working in web development. She uses a lot of the tools and things that we have used in this class, including view and node. She was actually the one that got me started working in view and working with the prime view component framework. So Heather has a lot of experience that’s going to be very relevant to what you’ve been doing.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week12/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
