So here we are, we’re at the last real week of the semester before finals week. Hopefully everybody was able to get through the advanced topics tutorial. Hopefully it worked really well. It’s a lot of stuff that I wanted to add at the end of the class, but didn’t really fit anywhere else. So it jumps around a little bit between some view topics and working with Docker and working with external databases. But I think it’s the last big pile of content I wanted you to get at the end of the semester. I have just published the final project, which you can find here on canvas. The final project links to a textbook page. Let me pull the textbook page over here real quick. So basically it has four different things I want you to do. I have not put together the rubric for these, but you can think of basically each one of these as roughly a quarter of the project. Some of them are going to be a little bit bigger than others, but hopefully you can get through those. And then I will actually show you my model solution.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week15/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
