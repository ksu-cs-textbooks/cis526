So we’re down here on week 14. So we’ve got some advanced topics on working with your RESTful API and view.js that you can take a look at. There’s a quick tutorial that you can run through. Mostly it’s just going through the stuff that I talk about in the textbook. Those advanced topics include using Pinia as a store to store data. We’ve kind of looked at Pinia a little bit but we haven’t dug into it too deeply. So this gives you another example for creating a Pinia store. We talk about ways that you can reuse components in your web app so that you can actually have these pop-up edit boxes that are really useful. And then the rest of the time we spend a lot of time talking about how to deploy your app using things like a Docker file, creating a Docker compose file to actually deploy it on a real server. And then we talk about the changes that you need to make to your application if you want to support an external database such as Postgres. And so what I want you to do is go through all these advanced topics, kind of get them working in your project and submit that.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week14/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
