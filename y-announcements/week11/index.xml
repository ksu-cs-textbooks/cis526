Over the weekend, I just published the materials for week 11 and week 12. So if you’re at that point and caught up, you can get started on that. Week 11 is going to add authentication to our RESTful API. So we’re going to add the ability to have background bypass authentication, as well as having CAS authentication, and we’re going to add role-based authorization to our project as well. So it’s a big change toward our backend. We’re also going to add a lot of unit tests for that to make sure all of our authorization and authentication is working properly.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week11/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
