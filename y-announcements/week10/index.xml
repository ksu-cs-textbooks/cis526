So over spring break, we shifted over to a lot of the new content that I’ve been working on for the semester. And so I see a lot of you have already completed some of the content for weeks 8, 9 and 10, which is great. Hopefully if you’re keeping up in the class, the content for week nine adding a database was due yesterday. So I see quite a few of you have done that. And then the third part, adding an API and unit tests is due this week. This is one of the larger milestones just because of the number of unit tests that you’re going to add to your project. So I really encourage you to try and get the tutorial done as soon as you can so that you’ve got plenty of time to work on the API and unit tests. That’s due next Monday.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/y-announcements/week10/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
