Web frameworks were designed meet these challenges, and to help programmers develop web applications more quickly and with less errors.  They do so through providing a standardized approach to building a web application, including imposing a software architecture, providing commonly-needed functionality, libraries for database communication, and generators to create boilerplate code. These frameworks built upon existing Web Stacks, allowing the programmer to focus almost exclusively on the scripting aspect.

A slew of frameworks for various scripting languages emerged in 2005:

* [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) using [PHP](https://php.net/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) using  [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Grails](https://grails.org/) using [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) (a Java Virtual Machine Language)

And new ones continue to emerge relatively often:

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) using [JavaScript (via Node)] in 2010
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) using [PHP](https://php.net/) in 2011
* [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) in 2014
* [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc) using .NET languages 2015

These represent only some of the best known _server-side_ frameworks. A newer trend are _client-side_ frameworks, which are built on JavaScript (or one of its derivatives) and run in the browser communicating with a web API.  Some of the best known of these include:

* [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) using JavaScript in 2011
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) using JavaScript in 2012
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) using JavaScript or JSX in 2013
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) using JavaScript in 2014
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) using TypeScript in 2016
* [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) using JavaScript or JSX in 2016

You can see there is a large variety represented and available to us - and these are only some of the best known!
