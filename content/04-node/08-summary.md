Node, and its package manager, npm, are powerful tools for developing server-side applications in JavaScript.  In the past chapter, we've discussed the event loop that drives Node's asynchronous, event-driven approach, and the asynchronous function pattern employed by many node libraries.  We've also talked about how Node.js code can be organized into modules, how those modules can be imported with a `require()` call, and how the node package manager (npm) can be used to download and install open-source packages locally.  Finally, we've discussed how to create our own local packages from our projects.

## Resources

Node can be downloaded from [nodejs.org](nodejs.org) or installed using [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

The latest Node documentation can be found at [https://nodejs.org/en/docs/](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
