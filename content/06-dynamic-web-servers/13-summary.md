In this chapter we have learned about several approaches to creating dynamic web servers, including _server pages_, _custom web servers_, and _full stack development_, often using a _web development framework_.  We also learned how dynamic webservers can handle data and file uploads from HTML forms, as well as some security concerns involved.  We also saw how state can be introduced to web apps using _cookies_ and _sessions_.  

In the next few chapters, we'll explore these ideas in more detail.
