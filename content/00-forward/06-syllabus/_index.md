### Course Overview

Fundamental principles and best practices of web development, user interface design, web API design, advanced web interfaces, web development frameworks, single-page web applications, web standards and accessibility issues.

### Course Description

This course focuses on the creation of web applications - programs that use the core technologies of the world-wide-web to deliver interactive and dynamic user experiences.  It builds upon a first course in authoring web pages using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, introduces the creation of web servers using the Node programming languages, and building sophisticated web clients using declarative component-based design frameworks like React. 

### Student Learning Outcomes

The following are the learning objectives of this course:

1. Students will develop a thorough understanding of the http client request - server response pattern, and be able to implement multiple kinds of requests and responses, including HTML tags, browser-based JavaScript, programmatically, and with tools.
2. Students will understand and be able to make use of asynchronous programming, including creating original asynchronous functions and utilizing promises and the async/await key words.
3. Students will be able to develop traditional full-stack web applications using Node, a SQL database, and a Linux OS.
4. Students will be able to develop client-side [progressive] web applications using transpilation and minimization.
5. Students will be able to develop secure web applications using password authentication, cookies, and json web tokens.

### Course Structure

This course is divided in modules, which typically consist of a series of lesson content (as video lectures or online textbook materials) followed by a hands-on tutorial.  The tutorials show how to take the ideas just discussed in the lessons and apply them in creating web applications in a step-by-step manner.  Following every third module is a larger project assignment, where you will utilize the skills you've been developing from the lessons and tutorials to iteratively create a web application. 

For the eight-week summer course, each cluster of three modules plus project should be completed in one week.  There is a lot to learn and much of the learning involved is hands-on as you work on the code for tutorials and your projects.  It is recommended you set aside 10-20 hours per week to focus on this course.

### The Work

There is no shortcut to becoming a great programmer or web developer. Only by **doing the work** will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful web developer. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.

**Lessons:** Lessons are delivered in written or video (with written transcript) form.  Sprinkled between lessons are activities and quizzes that check your understanding of the readings and lecture content.

**Tutorials:** Tutorials are delivered through Codio, and offer immediate, automatically generated feedback as you complete the assignments, letting you know if you've made a mistake or skipped a step.  You can run these assessments as many times as needed until you have completed the project to your satisfaction.

**Projects:** The projects are more free-form - I want you to be able to flex your creative muscles and make a web app that both meets your customer's needs and reflects your own style and approach.  These will be graded by hand using a rubric that focuses on functionality, code quality, accessibility, and aesthetics.

### Grading

In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. IIn this course, each assignment constitutes a a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:

* 15% - Activities & Quizzes
* 35% - Tutorials
* 50% - Projects

Up to 5% of the total grade in the course is available as extra credit.  See the **Extra Credit - Bug Bounty** and **Extra Credit - Helping Hand** assignments for details.

Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:

* 90% - 100% &rarr; A
* 80% - 89.99% &rarr; B
* 70% - 79.99% &rarr; C
* 60% - 59.99% &rarr; D*
* 50% - 0% &rarr; F

_* Note that CS Majors must earn a C or better to use the CIS 526 course for their degree._

### Submission, Regrading, and Early Grading Policy

As a rule, submissions in this course will not be graded until after they are due, even if submitted early. Students may resubmit assignments many times before the due date, and only the latest submission will be graded. For assignments submitted via GitHub release tag, only the tagged release that was submitted to Canvas will be graded, even if additional commits have been made. Students must create a new tagged release and resubmit that tag to have it graded for that assignment.

Once an assignment is graded, students are not allowed to resubmit the assignment for regrading or additional credit without special permission from the instructor to do so. In essence, students are expected to ensure their work is complete and meets the requirements before submission, not after feedback is given by the instructor during grading. However, students should use that feedback to improve future assignments and milestones. 

For the programming project milestones, it is solely at the discretion of the instructor whether issues noted in the feedback for a milestone will result in grade deductions in a later milestones if they remain unresolved, though the instructor will strive to give students ample time to resolve issues before any additional grade deductions are made.

Likewise, students may ask questions of the instructor while working on the assignment and receive help, but the instructor will not perform a full code review nor give grading-level feedback until after the assignment is submitted and the due date has passed. Again, students are expected to be able to make their own judgments on the quality and completion of an assignment before submission.

That said, a student may email the instructor to request early grading on an assignment before the due date, in order to move ahead more quickly. The instructor's receipt of that email will effectively mean that the assignment for that student is due immediately, and all limitations above will apply as if the assignment's due date has now passed. 

### Collaboration Policy

In this course, all work submitted by a student should be created solely by the student without any outside assistance beyond the instructor and TA/GTAs. Students may seek outside help or tutoring regarding concepts presented in the course, but should not share or receive any answers, source code, program structure, or any other materials related to the course. Learning to debug problems is a vital skill, and students should strive to ask good questions and perform their own research instead of just sharing broken source code when asking for assistance. 

That said, the field of web development requires the use of lots of online documentation and reference materials, and the point of the class is to learn how to effectively use those resources instead of "reinventing the wheel from scratch" in each assignment. Whenever content in an assignment is taken from an outside source, this should be noted somewhere in the assignment. 

### Late Work

{{% notice warning %}}
I've found that students prefer having more strict deadlines than more flexibility in a summer course, and many times they will perform better in the course when deadlines are enforced. Therefore, deadlines will be strictly enforced this semester. Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won't apply to you!
{{% /notice %}}

In this class, there is a tremendous amount of new skills to develop in a short amount of time. Falling behind _will_ jeopardize your chances of successfully completing the course. Trying to complete late assignments while also working on new material will also make it unlikely that you will retain what you are trying to learn.  It is critical that you keep on-track. 

Any work submitted and graded after the due date is subject to a deduction of **10% of the total points possible on the assignment for each day** that the assignment is late. For example, if an assignment is due on a Friday and is submitted the following Tuesday, it will be subject to a reduction of 40% of the total points possible, or 10% for each class day it was late. _These late penalties will be automatically entered by Canvas - contact the instructor if any grades appear to be incorrect._

These deductions will only be applied to grades above 50% of the total points on the assignment. So, if you scored higher than 50%, your grade will be reduced by the late penalty down to a minimum grade of 50%. If you scored lower than 50% on the assignment, no deductions will be applied.

However, even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.

All course work must be submitted, and all interactively graded materials must be graded with the instructor, on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time. No late work will be accepted after that date.

If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you know you have upcoming events that will prevent you from completing work in this course, you should contact the instructor ASAP and plan on working ahead before your event instead of catching up afterwards. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to catch up quickly. 

### Incomplete Policy

Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.

If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor's discretion. See the official [K-State Grading Policy](https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING) for more information. In general, _poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade_.

Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed [Incomplete Agreement Form](https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx), the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in this course:

1. Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester's finals week to complete the course
2. Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations
3. If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an 'F' in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.
4. For CC courses only:
   1. Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program.
   2. Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished
       1. For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete

### Recommended Texts & Supplies

To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.

In particular you are encouraged to use:
* [Node Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) - THe documentation for the Nodejs platform and APIs.
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) - A key reference explaining how browsers implement the web standards
* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - A collection of guides and articles on using CSS to accomplish a variety of tasks
* [w3c.org](https://www.w3.org/) - The online home of the World-Wide-Web Consortium, the organization that sets web technology standards

This course offers an instructor-written textbook, which is broken up into a specific reading order and interleaved with activities and quizzes in the modules. It can also be directly accessed at [{{< param textbookURL >}}]({{< param textbookURL >}}).

Students who would like additional textbooks should refer to resources available on the [O'Riley For Higher Education](https://go.oreilly.com/kansas-state-university) digital library offered by the Kansas State University Library.  These include electronic editions of popular textbooks as well as videos and tutorials.

### Subject to Change

The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.

### Academic Honesty

Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the [Honor and Integrity System](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/) apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work." A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

**For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.**

The Codio platform can perform automatic plagiarism detection by comparing submitted projects against other students' submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.

In this course, _unauthorized aid_ broadly consists of _giving or receiving code to complete assignments_.  This could be code you share with a classmate, code you have asked a third party to write for you, or code you have found online or elsewhere.  

Authorized aid - which is not a violation of the honor policy - includes
using the code snippets provided in the course materials, discussing strategies and techniques with classmates, instructors, TAs, and mentors. Additionally, you may use code snippets and algorithms found in textbooks and web sources if you clearly label them with comments indicating where the code came from and how it is being used in your project.

You should restrict your use of code libraries to those specified in the assignment description or approved by the instructor.  You can ask for approval via Discord in the course channel, and if granted, this approval is valid for the entire class _for the specified assignment_.   

{{% notice info %}}
While code libraries are an important and common tool in professional practice, at this point in your learning they can obscure how tasks are being accomplished, leaving your foundational knowledge incomplete.  It is for this reason that we restrict the use of code libraries in the course.
