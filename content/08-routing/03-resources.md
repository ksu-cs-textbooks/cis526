As the web transitioned to dyanamic pages, the concept of the URL path evolved.  With a static server, the path indicates an actual file that exists on teh fileserver.  But with dynamic pages, the url doesn't have to correspond to anything real.  Consider the case of [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/), a service that offers image URLs you can use in a site layout to simulate images.  For example, the image below is generated by the site by using the URL By using the URL `//via.placeholder.com/350x150`:

![350 x 150 pixel placeholder image](//via.placeholder.com/350x150)

Does Placeholder.com have thousands of images of varying sizes stored on a disk somewhere?  No!  It generates the image data _dynamically_ based on the request - here it reads the `350x150` and uses it to determine the size of the image needed.  It also reads other aspects of the URL and uses those to set other aspects, i.e. the url `//via.placeholder.com/350x150/C497FF/FFFFFF?text=Hello` generates the image:

![Another placeholder image with custom color and text](//via.placeholder.com/350x150/C497FF/FFFFFF?text=Hello) 

Clearly, we're conveying information to the Placeholder.com server _through the url_.  This is much like passing parameters to a function - it is how we communicate what we want the server to do with our request!

Let's revisit our blog server.  What if we adopted a similar approach there?  Our URLs might then look like:

* http://my-blog.com/posts/0-hello-web
* http://my-blog.com/posts/1-a-rose-by-any-other-name
* http://my-blog.com/posts/40-another-day

Where we use the _entire title_ as part of the URL! This makes it more human-readable, especially helpful when searching your browser history or scanning bookmarks.  But how would we handle this approach in our `handleRequest()`? You might recognize that we have a reoccuring _pattern_, which of course suggests we try a `RegExp`:

```js
public handleRequest(req, res) {
    
    // Separate the pathame from the url 
    const pathname = new URL(req.url, "http://localhost").pathname;

    // Determine if the request is for the index page
    if(pathname === '/') return serveHome(req, res);

    // Determine if the request is for a post 
    if(\$/post/\w+^\g.test(pathname)) return servePost(req, res);

    // Treat all other requests as a file 
    serveFile(req, res);
}
```

With this regular expression, we've effectively built a wildcard into our URL.  Any URL with a pattern `/posts/[postname]` will be treated as a post!
