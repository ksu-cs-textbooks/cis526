## Authentication Libraries

There are many different authentication libraries and methods available for Node.js and Express. For this project, we will use the [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/) library. It supports many different authentication methods, and is a very common way that authentication is handled within JavaScript applications.

So, to begin, let's install both `passport` and the `passport-cas` plugin:

```bash {title="terminal"}
$ 
```
