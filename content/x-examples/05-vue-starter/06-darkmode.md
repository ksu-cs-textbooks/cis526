## Configuration Dark Mode

Many applications today include two default themes, a "light-mode" and a "dark-mode," and users can choose which theme they receive by default through settings made either in their browser or their operating system. However, we can easily provide functionality in our application for users to override that setting if desired. The instructions for configuring a proper dark mode setup can be found in the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode), the [PrimeVue Documentation](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#darkmode), and a [helpful article](https://dev.to/abbeyperini/dark-mode-toggle-and-prefers-color-scheme-4f3m) describing how to detect the user's preference and store it in the browser's local storage. We'll integrate all three of these together into our component.
