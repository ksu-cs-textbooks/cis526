This example project builds on the previous RESTful API project by scaffolding a frontend application using Vue.js. This will become the basis for a full frontend for the application over the next few projects.

## Project Deliverables

At the end of this example, we will have a project with the following features:

1. A single page frontend application running in [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/).
2. Built-in Vue features such as [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) and [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).
3. Access to components and icons from [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/).
4. Access to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for additional CSS styling and features.
5. A working [Dark Mode Theme](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#darkmode) completed with a selector that remembers our preference.
6. A working [Vite](https://vite.dev/) server that will proxy requests to our backend RESTful API seamlessly.
7. An [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) client that can access our RESTful API routes.
8. A seamless system for authentication and requesting a JWT to access protected API routes.
