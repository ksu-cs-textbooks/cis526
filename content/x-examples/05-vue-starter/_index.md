This example project builds on the previous RESTful API project by scaffolding a frontend application using Vue.js. This will become the basis for a full frontend for the application over the next few projects.

## Project Deliverables

At the end of this example, we will have a project with the following features:

1. 

{{% notice warning "Prior Work" %}}

This project picks up right where the last one left off, so if you haven't completed that one yet, go back and do that before starting this one.

{{% /notice %}}

Let's get started!
