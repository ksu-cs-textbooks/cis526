## Summary

In this example project, we created an Express application with the following features:

1. GitHub Codespaces
2. A sample Express application
3. Updated to ES Modules
4. Application logs with Winston and Morgan
5. Other useful libraries such as Compression and Helmet
6. A better development server using Nodemon
7. Environment variables through Dotenvx
8. Code documentation with JSDoc and OpenAPI comments
9. Linting and Formatting with ESLint and Prettier

This example project makes a great basis for building robust RESTful web APIs and other Express applications.
