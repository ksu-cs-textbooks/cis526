This example project builds on the previous Vue.js CRUD app by discussing some more advanced topics related to web application development.

## Project Deliverables

At the end of this example, we will have a project with the following features:

1. 

{{% notice warning "Prior Work" %}}

This project picks up right where the last one left off, so if you haven't completed that one yet, go back and do that before starting this one.

{{% /notice %}}

Let's get started!
