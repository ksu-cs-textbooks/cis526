This example project builds on the previous Adding a Database project by using that project to create a [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). That API can be used to access and modify the data in the database. We'll also add a suite of unit tests to explore our API and ensure that it is working correctly.

## Project Deliverables

At the end of this example, we will have a project with the following features:

1. A RESTful API with several routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data in the database
2. Open API Documentation for API Routes
3. Full Unit Test Suite with Coverage Metrics
