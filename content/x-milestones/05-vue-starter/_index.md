This set of milestones is all about building a RESTful API and interface for the [Lost Kansas Communities](https://lostkansas.ccrsdigitalprojects.com/) project. 

## Milestone 5 - Vue Starter Project

Follow the instructions in the [Example Project](../../x-examples/05-vue-starter/) to build a project using Vue.js that includes the following features:

1. A single page frontend application running in [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/).
2. Built-in Vue features such as [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) and [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).
3. Access to components and icons from [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/).
4. Access to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for additional CSS styling and features.
5. A working [Dark Mode Theme](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#darkmode) completed with a selector that remembers our preference.
6. A working [Vite](https://vite.dev/) server that will proxy requests to our backend RESTful API seamlessly.
7. An [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) client that can access our RESTful API routes.
8. A seamless system for authentication and requesting a JWT to access protected API routes.

Effectively, just follow along with the example project and submit the resulting repository. This will be the starting point for the rest of the milestones!
