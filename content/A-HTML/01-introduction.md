Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) alongside Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) formed the core of Sir Tim Berners-Lee's world-wide web.  As the name implies, HTTP is a _markup language_, one that combines the text of what is being said with instructions on how to display it.

The other aspect of HTML is its _hyper-text_ nature.  Hyper-text refers to text that links to additional resources - primarily the links in the document, but also embedded multimedia.  

This ability to author structured pages that linked to other structured pages with a single mouse click is at the heart of the World-Wide-Web.

The HTML standard, along with many other web technologies, is maintained by the [World-Wide-Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) (abbrivated W3C), stakeholders who create and maintain web standards.  The full description of the Hyper-Text Markup Language can be found here [w3c's HTML page](https://www.w3.org/html/).
