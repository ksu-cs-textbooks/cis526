Hello, and welcome to the week six Announcements video for CIS 527 and CC 515 in summer 2022. This week, you should be wrapping up milestone four, which is due today. So make sure you get that submitted on time and it's ready to be graded. Then this week, you'll be working on the week six lessons which are due this Friday. And then Monday, you're going to have another milestone, which is milestone five. So start working on that as soon as you can. 

Week Six is all about a lot of different things related to full stack web development, we're going to introduce user authentication. So how do we actually authenticate our users with a password? How do we keep track of sessions and roles, so we'll see a lot of that. We're going to start talking about web API's a little bit, we'll also look at things like web hooks, how we can automatically deploy stuff and send stuff to another web server. And we'll start talking about web frameworks. And so you'll start looking at different ways you can build your website. And then this week, we're going to continue the blog tutorial where you'll have the last few bits of the blog tutorial, once the blog tutorial is done, you'll have a full stack web development project under your belt. And then we'll use a lot of that over the last couple of milestones to wrap up this course. 

Milestone five is obviously about adding authentication to your app. So you're going to need to add all of the forms and routes to manage logging in as a user logging out as a user creating a new user, you're also going to protect a few of the routes. So the logged in users can do certain things that unauthenticated users can't do. When they create a request, you're going to actually linked that request to the user itself. So only logged in users can add requests and the request itself will be tied to that user. This will involve some database changes. So make sure you're very careful. Make backups of your database if you need to, for those of you in CC 515 that maybe haven't had a database course, if you get stuck on the database changes, let me know. And I'm willing to help you a little bit on that so that you can get past that and get working on this milestone. So that's really it for this week. 

As always, if you have questions you can keep in touch on Discord, I have time office hours on Tuesdays and Fridays, you're welcome to join and just hang out while you work on assignments. I do one on one office hours via Calendly. So if you need any help in person, you can schedule a zoom time with me on Calendly. My all of my times are available there. Other than that, you'll be working on users and passwords. Hopefully you know that you should make your passwords pretty complex. So don't use 12345. Especially if it's the same number on your luggage. Good luck this week on adding user authentication to your milestone. As always, if have any questions, let me know and I look forward to seeing you again next week.
