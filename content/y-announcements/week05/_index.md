Hello, and welcome to the week five announcements video for CIS 526 and CC 515, in summer 2022. So this week, you should be working on week five, which is the second of a two week series that leads up toward milestone four, where we really shift our focus from static websites and a little bit of Ajax in the browser to full on dynamic websites using Express and all sorts of things around that. So it's a big shift, it's a two week milestone. So make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get working on this milestone. A big hint for me is if you start milestone four on Monday, you're probably not going to get it done and turn it in yet that day, it is quite a bigger project than the last few milestones. 

So this week, you're going to start learning a little bit more about full stack web development, we're going to cover template rendering, which is all about taking the ECMAScript templates that you learned last week. And expanding on that a bit. We're going to talk about data serialization and databases, how we can actually store data that is submitted to the website and then pull that back out and use that to render our pages, we're going to look at routing, how we can take the URL and use it to determine what functions or what templates to actually render. And then you're going to start working on the blog tutorial. And so this week next week, there are a series of tutorials where you will build an interactive blog. And it's really sets the stage for all of the full stack web development stuff that we're going to do in this course. So the blog tutorial really gives you a lot of the code that you're going to want to pull into the milestone as you work on the next milestone. 

So again, for milestone four, we're going to be pivoting our project into an Express app, we're going to be adding things like routing and the static middleware to handle some of those features, you're going to have various API endpoints for getting the boxes and getting information about the boxes, you'll have an SQL lite database that stores all the information from now on. And then you're going to build some dynamic pages that are actually rendered on the server and then presented to the user. And you're going to handle some form submission and actually storing data in the database. So again, it's a much more fully featured web app than the previous milestones, but it is a lot more complex. So make sure you keep that in mind. 

That's really all I've got for this week. As always, if you have questions or concerns, you can chat with me on Discord anytime you can join Tea Time office hours, which are Tuesdays at 330 Fridays at 1030. You can schedule a one on one office hour with me using my Calendly link, you can send me an email, I'm always here and happy to help so if you ever have questions or you get stuck on something and you need a little bit extra help, please let me know so that I can help you out. Otherwise, I hope things are going well this week. I hope you're not pulling your hair out too much with a really large milestone, but it does take a little bit effort. So make sure you keep that in mind. Hopefully have good luck with this milestone. As always, if you have any questions, let me know. And I will see you next week.
