If you think learning and writing SQL looks challenging, you're not alone. Early full-stack developers did as well.  In addition, there was the additonal need to convert the responses from the relational database from text into objects the program could use.  It shouldn't be surprising that libraries quickly were adopted to manage this process.  The most basic of these are _drivers_, simple programs which manage the connection between the database and the program using it, sending SQL queries to the database and parsing the results into data types native to the langauge (usually an array of arrays or an array of dictionaries - the outer array for the rows, and the inner array or dictionary for the column values within the row). 

However, the use of drivers was soon surplanted by [Object Relational Mapping (ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), a software layer that sits between the database and the dynamic web server program.  But unlike a driver, ORM libraries provide additional conversion logic.  Most will convert function calls to SQL statements and execute them on the server, and all will convert the results of a query into an object in the language of the server.

Let's look at a few ORMs in practice.

## ActiveRecord 

The [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) ORM is part of the [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) framework.  It takes advantage of the Ruby programming language's dynamic nature to vastly simplify the code a developer must write to use a database.  If we use our previous example of the database containing _persons_, _addresses_, and _jobs_ tables, we would write classes to represent each table that inherit from the `ActiveRecord` base class:

```ruby
# persons.rb
class Person < ApplicationRecord 
  has_many :addresses
  has_and_belongs_to_many :jobs
end

# addresses.rb 
class Address < ApplicationRecord 
  belongs_to :person 
end 

# jobs.rb 
class Job < ApplicationRecord 
    has_and_belongs_to :person
end
```

Then, to retrieve all people we would use a query method of the `Job` class::

```ruby
allPeople = Person.all()
```

Or to retrieve all doctors, we would use a query method of the `Job` class:

```ruby 
allDoctors = Person.includes(:jobs).where(jobs: {name: "Doctor"})
```

While we haven't been working in the Ruby langauge, I show this to help you understand just how far from SQL some ORMs go.  For a Ruby programmer, this is far more comfortable syntax than SQL, much like LINQ's method syntax is often more comfortable to C# programmers.

That said, there are always some queries - especially when we're trying to squeeze out the most efficency possible or working with a convoluted database - that are beyond the simple conversion abilities of an ORM to manage.  So most ORMs offer a way to run a SQL query directly on the database as well.

Finally, you should understand that any ORM that provides a functional interface for constructing SQL queries is effectively a domain-specific langauge that duplicates the functionality of SQL. The SQL generated by these libraries can be far less efficient than a hand-written SQL query written by a knowledgable programmer.  While it can be more comfortable to program in, it may be more valuable to spend the effort developing a solid understanding of SQL and how relational databases work.

## Massive
For Node applications, I've really come to prefer [MassiveJS](https://massivejs.org/), an ORM for the Postgres relational database.  Like other ORMs, it converts query results into a JavaScript object or array of objects, with the column names as keys and values as values, converted to the appropriate type. 

It does provide a slew of functions for generating queries programmatically, like other ORMs. But it also allows you to specify a folder in your project where you can place SQL files that are automatically converted to JavaScript functions that correspond to parameterized queries in the sql files.  For example, to do our "All doctors" query, we would write a file _scripts/allDoctors.sql_:

```js
