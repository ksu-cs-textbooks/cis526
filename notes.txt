## Web Development Stack

2022-05-20

Ran Updates

Installed:

* `build-essential`
* `git`
* NVM: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
* .NET 6.0 SDK and Runtime: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu#1804
* `sqlite3`

After installing NVM, install the latest version of NodeJS LTS (v16.15.0 as of this writing)

NOTE! You MUST symlink the node installed by NVM to the /usr/local/bin folder. That is the easiest way to make it the default version of node. This will need to be updated each time node is updated through NVM.

Use `which node` to find the path, then update in this command:
`sudo ln -s /home/codio/.nvm/versions/node/v16.15.0/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node`

You'll need to do the same for `npm` as well:
`sudo ln -s /home/codio/.nvm/versions/node/v16.15.0/bin/npm /usr/local/bin/npm`

Installed the following global Node packages:

* `ansi-to-html`
* `https://github.com/cis526-codio/avow` (Custom library by Nathan)
* `axios`
* `cheerio`
* `es6-promise`
* `highlight`
* `jest`
* `jest-cli`
* `jest-environment-jsdom`
    * Any existing `jest.config.json` files may need the following added: `"testEnvironment": "jsdom"`
* `jquery`
* `phantomjs-prebuilt` (note: I could not get the default `phantomjs` package to install properly)
* `showdown`
* `https://github.com/cis526-codio/codio-css-utils` (Custom fork of https://bitbucket.org/dwarfy/codio-css-utils/src/master/)
* `chalk@4.1.2` (newer versions of Chalk are pure ESM which doesn't play nice with current autograder. See https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/46930)
* `better-sqlite3`

Use `npm install -g --force <package>` to install packages globally. They will be in the `/home/codio/.nvm/versions/node/v16.15.0/lib/node_modules/` folder. 

To add these packages to the node path, each autograder references a script in this location: `/etc/profile.d/nodejs.sh`. So, on the stack, create that file with the following content:

```bash
export NODE_PATH=/home/codio/.nvm/versions/node/v16.15.0/lib/node_modules/
```

Update the path above to match the node version. This file will need to be created as root and given execute permissions `sudo chmod a+x nodejs.sh`
