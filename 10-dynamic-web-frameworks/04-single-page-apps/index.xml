In this pattern, the entire website consists of a single HTML page with very little content, mostly the &lt;script> elements to download a large client-side JavaScript library. Once downloaded, this library populates the page with HTML content by directly manipulating the DOM.
Consider a drawing application for creating pixel art. It is entirely possible to write a single-page application that only needs a webserver to serve its static HTML and JavaScript files.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/10-dynamic-web-frameworks/04-single-page-apps/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
