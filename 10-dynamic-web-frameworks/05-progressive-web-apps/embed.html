Most specifically, it is used to cache information for when the network is unavailable, which can allow your app to run offline.</p><h2 id=manifest-file>Manifest File</h2><p>The manifest is a JSON file that describes the application (much like the Node package.json) that provides the details necessary to load the app and &ldquo;install&rdquo; it on mobile devices.
