We can do <em>vertical scaling</em> - increasing the power of the server hardware - or <em>horizontal scaling</em> - adding additional servers to handle incoming requests. Not surprisingly, the second option is the most cost-effective. But for it to work, requests need to be handed quickly to the first available server - there is no room for making sure a subsequent request is routed to the same server.</p><p>Thus, HTTP was designed as a <em>stateless</em> protocol, in that each new HTTP request is treated as being completely independent from all previous requests from the same client. This means that when using horizontal scaling, if the first request from client BOB is processed by server NANCY, and the second request from BOB is processed by server MARGE, there is no need for MARGE to know how NANCY responded. This stateless property was critical to making the world-wide-web even possible with the earliest internet technologies.</p><p>Of course, you probably have experience with websites that <em>do</em> seem to keep track of state - i.e. online stores, Canvas, etc. One of the challenges of the modern web was building state on top of a stateless protocol; we&rsquo;ll discuss the strategies used to do so in later chapters.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis526/js/clipboard.min.js?1745333475 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1745333475 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/theme.js?1745333475 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/embed-iframe.js?1745333475 defer></script></body></html>
