This is the role that a Universal Resource Locator (a URL) plays. A URL is a specific kind of Universal Resource Indicator (URI) that specifies how a specific resource can be retrieved.
Info URLs and URIs The terms URL and URI are often used interchangeably in practice. However, a URL is a specific subset of URIs that indicate how to retrieve a resource over a network; while a URI identifies a unique resource, it does not necessarily indicate how to retrieve it. For example, a book’s ISBN can be represented as a URI in the form urn:isbn:0130224189. But this URI cannot be put into a browser’s Location to retrieve the associated book.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/02-http/05-uris-and-urls/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
