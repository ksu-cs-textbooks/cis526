For GET and DELETE requests, there is no body. For POST, PUT, and PATCH, however, this section should contain the data being sent to the server. If there is a body, the headers should include Content-Type and Content-Length. The Content-Length is always provided as a count of octets (a set of eight bits). Thus, binary data is sent as an octet stream.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/02-http/07-request-body/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
