So as we talked about last week, I’m kind of taking over this course from Dr. Bean, who’s going to be shifting over to cover another course for the rest of the semester. And so as part of that, one of the things I’ve been working on is a lot of new content for this course to introduce how you would actually build a RESTful API and a standalone single page front end application using some of the more industry standard techniques and practices. The early part of this class with Dr. Bean is really great because it shows you behind the scenes, the intricacies of how these things work. You get to build your own cookie parser, your own body parser. You build your own very low level handlers for a lot of these things. And so now we’re going to take a step up the food chain a little bit, and we’re going to rebuild some of these ideas using the standard stuff that Node and Express includes.",modified:"2025-03-11T11:36:36-05:00",tags:[],title:"Spring '25 Week 8",uri:"/cis526/y-announcements/week08/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Course Information",description:`Web Only This textbook was authored for the CIS 526 - Web Application Development course at Kansas State University.

These three technologies work together to create the web pages you interact with every day. Each has a role to play in defining the final appearance of a web page:
Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) provides the structure and content Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) determine how that content should appear visually JavaScript provides interactivity, allowing both the structure and appearance of the page to change dynamically We often refer to this division of responsibility as the separation of concerns. By placing all responsibility for appearance on a CSS file, we can refresh the look of a web application simply by replacing the old CSS file with a new one. Similarly, we can create a new page in our site that looks and feels like the rest of the site by creating a new HTML page that links to the site’s existing CSS files.`,modified:"2021-01-23T20:26:01-06:00",tags:[],title:"Introduction",uri:"/cis526/01-the-dom/01-introduction/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol",description:`At the heart of the world wide web is the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Once the web server receives the request, it must decide the appropriate response - ideally sending the requested resource back to the browser to be displayed.

Consider the directory listing from the previous chapter. It is not based on an existing file, but rather is dynamically created when requested by querying the file system of the server.

We revisit this diagram because it is so central to how HTTP servers work. At the heart, a server’s primary responsibility is to respond to an incoming request. Thus, in writing a web server, our primary task is to determine what to respond with. With static web servers, the answer is pretty simple - we map the virtual path supplied by the URL to a file path on the file server. But the URL supplied in a request doesn’t have to correspond to any real object on the server - we can create any object we want, and send it back.`,modified:"2022-07-28T18:52:31-05:00",tags:[],title:"Introduction",uri:"/cis526/08-routing/01-introduction/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Authentication",description:`An important part of any dynamic web server is controlling how, and by whom, it is used.

Collectively, these two concepts are often referred to by the abbreviation auth.
Consider a content management system (CMS) - a dynamic website for hosting content created by authorized users. The K-State website is an example of this kind of site - the events, articles, and pages are written by various contributors throughout the university.

We deliberately don't // catch errors, as if this process fails, we want // to stop the server loading process var fileData = fs.readFileSync('data.json'); var data = JSON.parse(fileData); /** @function get() * Returns the database object * @returns {object} data - the data object */ function get() { return data; } /** @function set() * Saves the provided object as the database data, * overwriting the current object * @param {object} newData - the object to save * @param {function} callback - triggered after save */ function set(newData, callback) { // Here we don't want the server to crash on // an error, so we do wrap it in a try/catch try { var fileData = JSON.stringify(newData); fs.writeFile("data.json", fileData, (err) => { // If there was an error writing the data, we pass it // forward in the callback and don't save the changes // to the data object if(err) return callback(err); // If there was no error, we save the changes to the // module's data object (the variable data declared above) data = newData // Then we invoke the callback to notify of success by sending // a value of null for the error callback(null); }); } catch (err) { // If we catch an error in the JSON stringification process, // we'll pass it through the callback callback(err); } } In this module, we exploit a feature of Node’s require, in that it caches the value returned by the require() function for each unique argument. So the first time we use require('./database'), we process the above code. Node internally stores the result (an object with the get() and set() method) in its module cache, and the next time we use require('./database') in our program, this object is what is required. Effectively, you end up using the same data variable every time you require('./database').

This will prompt the browser to display a username/password form and will re-submit the request with the credentials using an Authorization header.

This means for the most part, we can write code the way we are used to, with a few tweaks for asynchronous functions.

const fs = require('fs'); // Synchronous approach var data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt'); console.log(data); // Asynchronous approach fs.readFile('file.txt', function(err, data){ console.log(data); }); In the synchronous function, the contents of the file are returned, and assigned to the variable data. Conversely, in the asynchronous approach the file contents are passed into a callback function that is invoked when the asynchronous process finishes (and when the callback phase of the Node event loop is reached). The function itself returns nothing (undefined in Node). The important difference between the two is in the first approach, the program waits for the file to be read. In the second, the program keeps executing lines of code after the asynchronous call, even though the file hasn’t been read yet.`,modified:"2024-06-27T14:51:29-05:00",tags:[],title:"Asynchronous Functions",uri:"/cis526/04-node/03-asynchronous-functions/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Asynchronous JavaScript",description:"Implementing concurrency in computing systems comes with some specific challenges.

Allow the system to create new users if a user tries to authenticate with a username not currently in the database. That user should not be assigned any roles by default. Implement CAS authentication strategy in Passport.js as shown in the tutorial. Users should be able to authenticate via the https://testcas.cs.ksu.edu server.

Implement role-based authorization for ALL routes under the /api/v1 path. See below for a matrix of roles and allowed actions. Update unit tests for each route to use authentication and also to test role-based authorization as shown in the tutorial.

font-family defines the font to use for the text. Its value is one or more font family or generic font names, i.e. font-family: Tahoma, serif, font-family: cursive or font-family: "Comic Sans". Font family names are typically capitalized and, if they contain spaces or special characters, double-quoted. font-size determines the size of the font. It can be a measurement or a defined value like x-small. font-style determines if the font should use its normal (default), italic, or oblique face. font-weight determines the weight (boldness) of the font. It can be normal or bold as well as lighter or darker than its parent, or specified as a numeric value between 1 and 1000. Be aware that many fonts have a limited number of weights. line-height sets the height of the line box (the distance between lines of text). It can be normal, or a numeric or percent value. text-align determines how text is aligned. Possible values are left (default), center, right, justify, along with some newer experimental values. text-indent indents the text by the specified value. text-justify is used in conjunction with text-align: justify and specifies how space should be distributed. A value of inter-word distributes space between words (appropriate for English, Spanish, Arabic, etc), and inter-character between characters (appropriate for Japanese, Chinese, etc). text-transform can be used to capitalize or lowercase text. Values include capitalize, uppercase, and lowercase. Choosing Fonts An important consideration when working with HTML text is that not all users will have the same fonts you have - and if the font is not on their system, the browser will fall back to a different option.

In short, HTTP 2.0 was created to make the request-response pattern of the web more efficient. One method it uses to do so is switching from text-based representations of requests and responses to binary-based representations. As you probably remember from working with File I/O, binary files are much smaller than the equivalent text file. The same is true of HTTP requests and responses.
