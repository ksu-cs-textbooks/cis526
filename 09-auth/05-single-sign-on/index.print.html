authentication approach. These challenges can be broken into two categories, those that face us as the programmer, and those that arise from our users:</p><h4 id=programmer-challenges>Programmer Challenges</h4><p>For us as the programmer, there are a lot of steps in creating an authentication strategy that we <em>must</em> get right. We also must be very careful about how we store the authentication data - i.e. passwords should <strong>always</strong> be stored encrypted, never as plain text. And having actual authentication data in our site makes us a juicer target for adversaries, and potentially ups the stakes if our site is compromised.</p><p>Finally, what constitutes best practice in authentication <em>is constantly changing</em>. And to make sure we are doing everything as securely as possible <em>we should be updating our apps to follow current best practices.</em> This is obviously a lot of work.</p><h4 id=user-challenges>User Challenges</h4><p>For the user, having <em>yet another login and password</em> contributes to a number of problems. Users struggle to remember multiple passwords, and often default to using the <em>same</em> login and password across multiple sites. This means their credentials are only as secure as the worst-implemented security of those sites. While your app might have stellar security, your user might be compromised by a completely different site you have no influence over. Also, users often resort to writing down credentials - leaving them open to being found and used by others.</p><h3 id=single-sign-on>Single Sign On</h3><p>Single-sign on is a solution to both sets of challenges. The basic idea is to have one authentication service that is used for multiple, often completely independent applications. A user only needs to remember one login and password for <em>all</em> the applications, and authentication is done on one special-built server that can be updated to the latest best practices with ease.</p><p>Of course, to implement single-sign on, we need a way to establish trust between the authenticating server and the other web apps that use it. Thus, we need a standardized process to draw upon. We&rsquo;ll discuss several in the next couple of sections.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis526/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1755561291 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1755561291 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/theme.min.js?1755561291 defer></script></div><script src=/cis526/js/tele-scroll.min.js?1755561291 defer></script></body></html>
