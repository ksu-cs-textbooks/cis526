In fact, the original URL specification included an optional username and password as part of its format (specified as <code>[username]:[password]@</code> between the protocol and host). I.e. to make a HTTP authenticated request against the CS departmental server you might use:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0><code>https://willie:purpleandwhite@cs.ksu.edu/</code></pre></div><p>However, the use of authentication URLS is now highly discouraged and has been stripped from most browsers, as it is considered a security risk. Instead, if you are using <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication rel=external target=_blank>HTTP-based authentication</a> the server needs to issue a challenge <strong>401 Unauthorized</strong> response, along with a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header specifying the challenge. This will prompt the browser to display a username/password form and will re-submit the request with the credentials using an <code>Authorization</code> header. The process looks something like this:</p><p><a href=#R-image-327d5c0754229574eeee568c0698ae81 class=lightbox-link><img alt="The HTTP Authentication process" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis526/images/9.2.1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>
<a href=javascript:history.back(); class=lightbox-back id=R-image-327d5c0754229574eeee568c0698ae81><img alt="The HTTP Authentication process" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading=lazy src=/cis526/images/9.2.1.png></a></p><p>As you can see, when the client makes a request that requires authentication, the server issues a <strong>401 Unauthorized</strong> status code, along with an <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header specifying the authentication scheme. This prompts the browser to request the user credentials via a dialog (much like the one created by the JavaScript functions <code>alert()</code>, <code>confirm()</code>, and <code>prompt()</code>). If the user supplies credentials, the request is re-sent, with those credentials included in an <code>Authentication</code> header. The server then decides, based on the credentials, if it will allow the request (typically a <strong>200</strong> response), or refuse (a <strong>403 Unauthorized</strong> response).</p><p>The <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header looks like:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0><code>WWW-Authenticate: [type] realm=[realm]</code></pre></div><p>Where <code>[type]</code> is the authentication scheme (<code>Basic</code> being the most common), and <code>realm</code> describing the protected part of the server.</p><p>In the Basic authentication scheme, the content of the <code>Authorization</code> header is the string <code>[username]:[password]</code> encoded in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 rel=external target=_blank>base64</a>, where <code>[username]</code> is the users&rsquo; username, and <code>[password]</code> is their password.</p><div class="box notices cstyle warning"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div><div class=box-content><p>Base64 encoding is easy to undo, so you should only use HTTP Basic Authentication with the <code>https</code> protocol, which encrypts the request headers. Otherwise, anyone along the path the user&rsquo;s request travels can capture and decrypt the user&rsquo;s credentials.</p></div></div><p>The standard also defines other authorization schemes, but none are widely used today. Instead, most web developers have opted to build authentication directly into their web application. We&rsquo;ll discuss several of the most common approaches next.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis526/js/clipboard.min.js?1745849589 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1745849589 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/theme.js?1745849589 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/tele-scroll.js?1745849589 defer></script></body></html>
