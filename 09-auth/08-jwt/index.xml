This is often stored within a cookie (which means it can be used to persist a connection with a web app). However, as the web matured, a more robust identity token became a standard: the JSON Web Token (JWT).
A JSON Web Token (JWT) consists of three parts:
A header with metadata A payload consisting of the data needed to identify the user A cryptographic signature verifying the payload and header The JWT puts the user information directly into a token that is served by the authentication server. So if we want to identify a user by email, their email is in the payload. The header provides information like when the JWT will expire, and what cryptographic algorithm was used to generate the signature. And the signature was created using the specified cryptographic algorithm on the header and payload. This signature is what gives a JWT its robustness; when used correctly makes it impossible to modify the payload without the tampering being evident.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/09-auth/08-jwt/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
