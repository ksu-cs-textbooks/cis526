This is often stored within a cookie (which means it can be used to persist a connection with a web app). However, as the web matured, a more robust identity token became a standard: the JSON Web Token (JWT).
A JSON Web Token (JWT) consists of three parts:
A header with metadata A payload consisting of the data needed to identify the user A cryptographic signature verifying the payload and header The JWT puts the user information directly into a token that is served by the authentication server. So if we want to identify a user by email, their email is in the payload. The header provides information like when the JWT will expire, and what cryptographic algorithm was used to generate the signature. And the signature was created using the specified cryptographic algorithm on the header and payload. This signature is what gives a JWT its robustness; when used correctly makes it impossible to modify the payload without the tampering being evident."><meta name=author content="Nathan Bean & Russell Feldhausen"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/images/hero.png"><meta name=twitter:title content="JSON Web Tokens :: CIS 526 Textbook"><meta name=twitter:description content="A common thread across single-sign-on approaches is the issuing of some kind of ticket or certificate to identify the signed-in user.

The hash is <em>created</em> with the private key on the authentication server on a successful login. It can be <em>decoded</em> by an application using the <em>public</em> key. The decoded data should match that of the header and payload <em>exactly</em>. If it does, this proves the JWT was created by the authentication server (as you can&rsquo;t create one without the private key) and hasn&rsquo;t been tampered with. If it <em>is</em> tampered with, i.e someone changes the payload, the signature will no longer match.</p><p>Because of this tamper-resistant nature, JWT has quickly become a standard form for authentication tokens.</p><p>You can learn more about the JWT approach at <a href=https://jwt.io/ rel=external target=_blank>https://jwt.io/</a>.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis526/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1769640562 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1769640562 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/theme.min.js?1769640562 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/embed-iframe.min.js?1769640562 defer></script></body></html>
