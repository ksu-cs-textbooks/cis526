The primary difference in this approach from the HTTP Basic one is that:
The webserver provides a login page with a form for submitting the username/password (allowing it to be customized to match the site) On an successful authentication, a cookie is used to persist the user’s session, rather than re-submitting the Authentication header The actual difference in your server code between the two approaches is not that large.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/09-auth/03-password-auth/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
