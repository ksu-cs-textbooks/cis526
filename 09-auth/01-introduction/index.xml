This is the domain of authentication and authorization. Authentication refers to mechanisms used to establish the identity of a user, and authorization refers to determining if an authenticated user has permission to do the requested action in the system. Collectively, these two concepts are often referred to by the abbreviation auth.
Consider a content management system (CMS) - a dynamic website for hosting content created by authorized users. The K-State website is an example of this kind of site - the events, articles, and pages are written by various contributors throughout the university. It is important that only authorized agents of the university (i.e. staff and faculty) are allowed to publish this content. Can you imagine what would happen if anyone could post anything on the K-State website?</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/09-auth/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
