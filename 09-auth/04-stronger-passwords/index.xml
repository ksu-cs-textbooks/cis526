While we can’t force users to use good passwords, we can encourage them to do so, and potentially build some requirements/guidance into our sign up forms.
You’ve likely been told multiple times that a good password is a mix of numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special symbols. While this is indeed marginally better than a password of the same length that uses only letters, it isn’t much. Remember that with some clever programming and a graphics card, passwords can be brute-forced. The amount of time this takes is more dependent on the length of the password than the combination of characters. This XKCD comic sums up the issue succinctly:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/09-auth/04-stronger-passwords/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
