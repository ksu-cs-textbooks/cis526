This will become the basis for a full frontend for the application over the next few projects.
Project Deliverables At the end of this example, we will have a project with the following features:
A single page frontend application running in Vue 3. Built-in Vue features such as Vue Router and Pinia. Access to components and icons from PrimeVue. Access to Tailwind CSS for additional CSS styling and features. A working Dark Mode Theme completed with a selector that remembers our preference. A working Vite server that will proxy requests to our backend RESTful API seamlessly. An Axios client that can access our RESTful API routes. A seamless system for authentication and requesting a JWT to access protected API routes. Prior Work This project picks up right where the last one left off, so if you haven’t completed that one yet, go back and do that before starting this one.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Vue Starter</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/01-vue-starter/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/01-vue-starter/index.html</guid><description>Vue Starter Now that we’ve built a solid backend for our application through our RESTful API, we can now start on building the frontend application that our users will actually interface with. There are many techniques and tools for writing frontend applications that we’ve covered in this course, but for this project we’re going to introduce once more, called Vue. Vue is very similar to React, but uses a more streamlined syntax and structure. It also includes a lot of built-in features that make writing an interactive web application a very seamless experience. As with any tool we’ve introduced in this set of tutorials, it is always a good idea to review the Vue Documentation as we add features to our application.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Vue</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/02-exploring/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/02-exploring/index.html</guid><description>Install the Vue Extension First, in our Visual Studio Code instance, we will want to install the Vue - Official extension. Make sure it is the correct, official plugin, since there are many that share a similar name in the VS Code extension marketplace:</description></item><item><title>PrimeVue</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/03-primevue/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/03-primevue/index.html</guid><description>Install PrimeVue One of the first things we may want to install in our application is a library of ready-to-use components that we can use to build our application with. This can drastically cut down on the time it takes to build an application, and these libraries often come with a range of features that make our applications both user-friendly and very accessible.</description></item><item><title>Routing</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/04-routing/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/04-routing/index.html</guid><description>Vue Router Our Vue project already includes an instance of the Vue Router, which is used to handle routing between the various views, or pages, within our application. So, let’s take a minute to explore how the Vue Router works and how we can integrate it into our Menubar so we can move between the various views in our application.</description></item><item><title>Tailwind</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/05-tailwind/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/05-tailwind/index.html</guid><description>Integrating Tailwind While PrimeVue includes many helpful components we can use in our application, we may still need to adjust the layout a bit to match our expected style. For example, right now the content of each of our views has no margins or padding around it:</description></item><item><title>Dark Mode</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/06-darkmode/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/06-darkmode/index.html</guid><description>Configuring Dark Mode Many applications today include two default themes, a “light-mode” and a “dark-mode,” and users can choose which theme they receive by default through settings made either in their browser or their operating system. However, we can easily provide functionality in our application for users to override that setting if desired. The instructions for configuring a proper dark mode setup can be found in the Tailwind CSS Documentation, the PrimeVue Documentation, and a helpful article describing how to detect the user’s preference and store it in the browser’s local storage. We’ll integrate all three of these together into our component.</description></item><item><title>Icons</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/07-icons/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/07-icons/index.html</guid><description>Adding Icons One of the best ways to make a web user interface very accessible and easy to use is by using globally recognized icons to represent certain actions, such as logging in, returning to the homepage, and editing items. Thankfully, there is an easy to use icon package that works directly with PrimeVue called PrimeIcons that we can use in our project. So, let’s quickly install that icon pack and see how we can use it in our application.</description></item><item><title>API Proxy</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/08-api-proxy/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/08-api-proxy/index.html</guid><description>Warning The video adds an extra slash to the /auth route in the vite.config.js file when setting up a proxy. That slash should be removed.
Connecting to our RESTful API Now that we have the basic structure of our application built and are becoming more familiar with both Vue and PrimeVue, let’s work on connecting to our backend RESTful API application and see if we can retrieve some data from our database. This is really the key feature that we want ensure works in our frontend application!</description></item><item><title>Authentication</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/09-auth/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/09-auth/index.html</guid><description>Handling User Authentication The time has come for us to finally handle user authentication on our frontend application. There are several different pieces that need to work together seamlessly for this to work properly, so let’s explore what that looks like and see what it takes to get our users properly authenticated so they can access secure data in our application.</description></item><item><title>Route Guards</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/10-routeguard/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/10-routeguard/index.html</guid><description>Warning In this video, the new api.js file was accidentally created in the router folder. It should be moved to the configs folder, which is shown in the next video.
Automatically Logging In One thing we may quickly realize as we use our application as it currently stands is that the user has to click the “Login” button twice to actually get logged into the system. That seems a bit counterintuitive, so we should take a minute to try and fix that.</description></item><item><title>Accessing API</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/11-accessing-api/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/05-vue-starter/11-accessing-api/index.html</guid><description>Accessing the API Finally, let’s see what it takes to actually access data that is available in our RESTful API using a properly authenticated request. For this example, we’re going to create a simple ProfileView page that the user can access by clicking the Profile button available after they’ve logged in. This page is just a test, but it will quickly demonstrate what we can do with our existing setup.</description></item></channel></rss>
