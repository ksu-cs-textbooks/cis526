Client Update Token Store In my Vue code, I was often using tokenStore.token.length > 0 to determine if a user was logged in. This is a bit fragile - better to just make a computed value for this:
​ client/src/stores/Token.js // Getters const loggedIn = computed(() => token.value.length > 0 ) This requires changing several other places in ths code where this is used - mainly I just searched for token.length and went from there.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/08-errata/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
