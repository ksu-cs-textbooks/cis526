That API can be used to access and modify the data in the database. We’ll also add a suite of unit tests to explore our API and ensure that it is working correctly.
Project Deliverables At the end of this example, we will have a project with the following features:
A RESTful API with several routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data in the database Open API Documentation for API Routes Full Unit Test Suite with Coverage Metrics Prior Work This project picks up right where the last one left off, so if you haven’t completed that one yet, go back and do that before starting this one.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>API Design</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/01-api-design/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/01-api-design/index.html</guid><description>Good API Design There are many articles online that discuss best practices in API design. For this project, we’re going to follow a few of the most common recommendations:
API Versioning Proper Naming Conventions Proper HTTP Methods Proper HTTP Status Code Responses Let’s start with the first one - we can easily add a version number to our API’s URL paths. This allows us to make breaking changes to the API in the future without breaking any of the current functionality.</description></item><item><title>Unit Testing</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/02-unit-testing/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/02-unit-testing/index.html</guid><description>Testing Web APIs Now that we have created our first route in our RESTful API, we can start to write unit tests that will confirm our API works as intended. Adding unit testing early in the development process makes it much easier to keep up with unit tests as new features are added or even explore test-driven development!</description></item><item><title>Code Coverage</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/03-coverage/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/03-coverage/index.html</guid><description>Code Coverage It is often helpful to examine the code coverage of our unit tests. Thankfully, there is an easy way to enable that in our project using the c8 library. So, we can start by installing it:
​ terminal $ npm install --save-dev c8 Once it is installed, we can simply add it to a new script in the package.json file that will run our tests with code coverage:</description></item><item><title>Other Tests</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/04-other-tests/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/04-other-tests/index.html</guid><description>Testing for Other Issues Let’s consider the scenario where our routes/api.js file was modified slightly to have some incorrect code in it:
​ routes/api.js // -=-=- other code omitted here -=-=- router.get('/', function (req, res, next) { res.json([ { versoin: "1.0", url: "/api/ver1/" } ]) }) In this example, we have misspelled the version attribute, and also used an incorrect URL for that version of the API. Unfortunately, if we actually make that change to our code, our existing unit test will not catch either error!</description></item><item><title>Testing Roles</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/05-testing-roles/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/05-testing-roles/index.html</guid><description>Unit Testing Roles Routes Now that we’ve created a basic unit test for the /api route, we can now expand on that to test our other existing route, the /api/v1/roles route. Once again, there is only one method inside of this route, the GET ALL method, so the unit tests should be similar between these two routes. The only difference here is this route is now reading from the database instead of just returning a static JSON array.</description></item><item><title>Retrieve All</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/06-retrieve-all/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/06-retrieve-all/index.html</guid><description>Users Routes Now that we have written and tested the routes for the Role model, let’s start working on the routes for the User model. These routes will be much more complex, because we want the ability to add, update, and delete users in our database.
To do this, we’ll create several RESTful routes, which pair HTTP verbs and paths to the various CRUD operations that can be performed on the database. Here is a general list of the actions we want to perform on most models in a RESTful API, based on their associated CRUD operation:</description></item><item><title>Retrieve One</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/07-retrieve-one/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/07-retrieve-one/index.html</guid><description>Retrieve One Route Many RESTful web APIs also include the ability to retrieve a single object from a collection by providing the ID as a parameter to the route. So, let’s go ahead and build that route in our application as well.
Unused in Practice While this route is an important part of many RESTful web APIs, it can often go unused since most frontend web applications will simply use the retrieve all endpoint to get a list of items, and then it will just cache that result and filter the list to show a user a single entry. However, there are some use cases where this route is extremely useful, so we’ll go ahead and include it in our backend code anyway.</description></item><item><title>Create</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/08-create/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/08-create/index.html</guid><description>Create Route Now that we’ve explored the routes we can use to read data from our RESTful API, let’s look at the routes we can use to modify that data. The first one we’ll cover is the create route, which allows us to add a new entry to the database. However, before we do that, let’s create some helpful utility functions that we can reuse throughout our application as we develop more advanced routes.</description></item><item><title>Testing Create</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/09-testing-create/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/09-testing-create/index.html</guid><description>Manual Testing with Open API Before we start unit testing this route, let’s quickly do some manual testing using the Open API documentation site. It is truly a very handy way to work with our RESTful APIs as we are developing them, allowing us to test them quickly in isolation to make sure everything is working properly.</description></item><item><title>Update</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/10-update/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/10-update/index.html</guid><description>Update Route Next, let’s look at adding an additional route in our application that allows us to update a User model. This route is very similar to the route used to create a user, but there are a few key differences as well.
​ routes/api/v1/users.js // -=-=- other code omitted here -=-=- /** * Update a user * * @param {Object} req - Express request object * @param {Object} res - Express response object * @param {Function} next - Express next middleware function * * @swagger * /api/v1/users/{id}: * put: * summary: update user * tags: [users] * parameters: * - in: path * name: id * required: true * schema: * type: integer * description: user ID * requestBody: * description: user * required: true * content: * application/json: * schema: * $ref: '#/components/schemas/User' * example: * username: updateduser * roles: * - id: 6 * - id: 7 * responses: * 201: * $ref: '#/components/responses/Success' * 422: * $ref: '#/components/responses/ValidationError' */ router.put("/:id", async function (req, res, next) { try { const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id) // if the user is not found, return an HTTP 404 not found status code if (user === null) { res.status(404).end(); } else { await database.transaction(async (t) => { await user.update( // Update the user object using body attributes { username: req.body.username, }, // Assign to a database transaction { transaction: t, }, ); // If roles are included in the body if (req.body.roles) { // Find all roles listed const roles = await Promise.all( req.body.roles.map(({ id, ...next }) => { return Role.findByPk(id); }), ); // Attach roles to user await user.setRoles(roles, { transaction: t }); } else { // Remove all roles await user.setRoles([], { transaction: t }); } // Send the success message sendSuccess("User saved!", user.id, 201, res); }); } } catch (error) { if (error instanceof ValidationError) { handleValidationError(error, res); } else { logger.error(error); res.status(500).end(); } } }); // -=-=- other code omitted here -=-=- As we can see, overall this route is very similar to the create route. The only major difference is that we must first find the user we want to update based on the query parameter, and then we use the update database method to update the existing values in the database. The rest of the work updating the related Roles models is exactly the same. We can also reuse the utility functions we created for the previous route.</description></item><item><title>Delete</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/11-delete/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/03-rest-api/11-delete/index.html</guid><description>Delete Route Finally, the last route we need to add to our users routes is the delete route. This route is very simple - it will remove a user based on the given user ID if it exists in the database:
​ routes/api/v1/users.js // -=-=- other code omitted here -=-=- /** * Delete a user * * @param {Object} req - Express request object * @param {Object} res - Express response object * @param {Function} next - Express next middleware function * * @swagger * /api/v1/users/{id}: * delete: * summary: delete user * tags: [users] * parameters: * - in: path * name: id * required: true * schema: * type: integer * description: user ID * responses: * 200: * $ref: '#/components/responses/Success' */ router.delete("/:id", async function (req, res, next) { try { const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id) // if the user is not found, return an HTTP 404 not found status code if (user === null) { res.status(404).end(); } else { await user.destroy(); // Send the success message sendSuccess("User deleted!", req.params.id, 200, res); } } catch (error) { console.log(error) logger.error(error); res.status(500).end(); } }); // -=-=- other code omitted here -=-=- Once again, we can test this route using the Open API documentation website. Let’s look at how we can quickly unit test it as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
