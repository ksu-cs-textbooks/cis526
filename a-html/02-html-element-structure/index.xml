Each element in HTML is defined by a unique opening and closing tag, which in turn are surrounded by angle brackets (&lt;>).
For example, a top-level heading in HTML would be written:
&lt;h1>Hello World&lt;/h1>
And render:
Hello World The &lt;h1> is the opening tag and the &lt;/h1> is the closing tag. The name of the tag appears immediately within the &lt;> of the opening tag, and within the closing tag proceeded by a forward slash (/). Between the opening tag and closing tag is the content of the element. This can be text (as in the case above) or it can be another HTML element.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/a-html/02-html-element-structure/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
