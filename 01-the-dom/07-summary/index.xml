We discussed how CSS rules are applied to nodes in this tree to determine how the final webpage will be rendered, and how JavaScript can be used to manipulate and transform the DOM (and the resulting webpage appearance).
We also discussed how JavaScript events work, and how this event-driven approach is the basis for implementing concurrency within the language.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/01-the-dom/07-summary/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
