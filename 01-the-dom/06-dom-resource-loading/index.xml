It also involves a collection of resources that are external to the HTML document, but displayed or utilized by the document. These include elements like &lt;link>, &lt;script>, &lt;video>, &lt;img>, and &lt;source> with src or href attributes set.
As the DOM tree is parsed and loaded and these external resources are encountered, the browser requests those resources as well. Modern browsers typically make these requests in parallel for faster loading times.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/01-the-dom/06-dom-resource-loading/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
