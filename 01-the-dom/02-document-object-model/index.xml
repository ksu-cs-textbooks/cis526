The browser then makes this data structure accessible to scripts running on the page. The DOM is essentially a tree composed of objects representing the HTML elements and text on the page.
Consider this HTML:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html> &lt;html> &lt;head> &lt;title>Hello DOM!&lt;/title> &lt;link href="site.css"/> &lt;/head> &lt;body> &lt;div class="banner"> &lt;h1>Hello DOM!&lt;/h1> &lt;p> The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data. &lt;/p> &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/introduction.html">From w3.org's What is the Document Object Model?&lt;/a> &lt;/div> &lt;/body> &lt;html> When it is parsed by the browser, it is transformed into this tree:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/01-the-dom/02-document-object-model/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
