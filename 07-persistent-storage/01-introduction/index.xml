In this approach, the HTML the server sends as a response does not need to be stored on the server as a HTML file, rather it can be constructed when a request is made.
That said, most web applications still need a persistent storage mechanism to use in dynamically creating those pages. If we’re dealing with a forum, we need to store the text for the posts. If we’re running an e-commerce site, we aren’t making up products, we’re selling those already in our inventory.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/07-persistent-storage/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
