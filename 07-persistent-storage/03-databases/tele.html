Doing so has clear benefits - such programs are typically stable, secure, and optimized for data storage and retrieval. They are well beyond what we can achieve ourselves without a significant investment of time, and avoids the necessity of &ldquo;reinventing the wheel&rdquo;.</p><p>That said, making effective use of a third-party database system <em>does</em> require you to develop familiarity with how the database operates and is organized. Gaining the benefits of a database&rsquo;s optimizations requires structuring your data in the way its developers anticipated, and likewise retrieving it in such a manner. The exact details involved vary between database systems and are beyond the scope of this course, which is why you have a database course in your required curriculum. Here I will just introduce the details of how to integrate the use of a database into your web development efforts, and I&rsquo;ll leave the learning of how to best optimize your database structure and queries for that course.</p><p>In the web development world, we primarily work with two kinds of databases, which have a very different conceptual starting point that determines their structure. These are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database rel=external target=_blank>Relational Databases</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database rel=external target=_blank>Document-oriented Databases</a> (sometimes called No-SQL databases). There is a third category, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database rel=external target=_blank>Object-oriented Databases</a> that are not widely adopted, and a slew of less-well known and utilized technologies. There are also cloud services that take over the role traditionally filled by databases, which we&rsquo;ll save for a later chapter. For now, we&rsquo;ll focus on the first two, as these are the most commonly adopted in the web development industry.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis526/js/clipboard.min.js?1743816707 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1743816707 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/theme.js?1743816707 defer></script><script src=/cis526/js/tele-scroll.js?1743816707 defer></script></body></html>
