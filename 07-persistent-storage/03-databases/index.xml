Doing so has clear benefits - such programs are typically stable, secure, and optimized for data storage and retrieval. They are well beyond what we can achieve ourselves without a significant investment of time, and avoids the necessity of “reinventing the wheel”.
That said, making effective use of a third-party database system does require you to develop familiarity with how the database operates and is organized. Gaining the benefits of a database’s optimizations requires structuring your data in the way its developers anticipated, and likewise retrieving it in such a manner. The exact details involved vary between database systems and are beyond the scope of this course, which is why you have a database course in your required curriculum. Here I will just introduce the details of how to integrate the use of a database into your web development efforts, and I’ll leave the learning of how to best optimize your database structure and queries for that course.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/07-persistent-storage/03-databases/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
